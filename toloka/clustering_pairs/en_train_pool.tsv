https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadband/327877-ispa-hits-back-at-telkom-ceos-strange-isp-comments.html	The Internet Service Providers’ Association (ISPA) has hit back at Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko’s comments that Internet service providers (ISPs) are a relic of the past. Responding to questions about Telkom Internet’s all-access subscriber decline, Maseko said its Internet service provider business has become insignificant. “The way people consume the Internet now is no longer through an ISP,” Maseko said. “Once they get Wi-Fi connectivity, they don’t need an ISP.” “The ISP came back as a relic of the past when people did not have email – they did not have all of the things which would essentially be the gateway to break out into the Internet.” “But now you are able to break out into the Internet using fibre or LTE, or even on your smartphone. You don’t need an ISP to get into the Internet today.” ISPA told MyBroadband that Maseko’s declaration that ISPs are “a relic of the past” was met with surprise by ISPA’s 190 members and the hundreds of thousands of South Africans receiving Internet access and related services from them. “ISPA understands that the comments were made in the context of Telkom losing substantial numbers of customers in its fixed ISP business, but suggests that these customers may, in fact, have opted for better, more affordable services from Telkom’s competitors,” ISPA said. The organisation added that a decline in Telkom’s fixed ISP business was “in any event perhaps inevitable once it was no longer able to force subscribers to take both its voice and ADSL products”. ISPA added that it is high time that the mobile networks – including Telkom Mobile – recognised that their main business is now being ISPs. This is both from a legal point of view and in the minds of the millions of South Africans who buy access to the Internet from them. “This recognition will assist these operators to better understand the Internet Protocol and the role it plays in how consumers get online,” ISPA said. Telkom was asked for feedback regarding Maseko’s comments, but the company did not respond by the time of publication.	https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/11/08/report-amazon-ring-doorbells-exposed-home-wi-fi-passwords-to-hackers/	0.8643343448638916	ISPA hits back at Telkom CEO’s strange ISP comments	TechCrunch reports that security researchers at Bitdefender have claimed that Amazon Ring doorbells were sending users Wi-Fi passwords in cleartext as the doorbell joins the home network. This would allow hackers to intercept the Wi-Fi password and gain access to users’ local network. Bitdefender stated: “When first configuring the device, the smartphone app must send the wireless network credentials. This takes place in an unsecure manner, through an unprotected access point. Once this network is up, the app connects to it automatically, queries the device, then sends the credentials to the local network.” All of this happens over an unencrypted connection which exposes the Wi-Fi password being sent over the air. The vulnerability was reportedly fixed by Amazon in September but the vulnerability was only recently disclosed. A Ring spokesperson provided the following statement to Breitbart News: “Customer trust is important to us and we take the security of our devices seriously. We rolled out an automatic security update addressing the issue, and it’s since been patched.” This is yet another vulnerability recently discovered in smart home devices, Breitbart News reported a team of researchers from Tokyo’s University of Electro-Communications and the University of Michigan recently claimed to have discovered a way to “hijack” voice-enabled devices by shining a laser at the microphones of the devices.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/white-house-trump-having-tests-as-part-of-medical-checkup/article29995883.ece	President Donald Trump was at Walter Reed National Medical Center on Saturday for what the White House said were medical tests as part of his annual physical. The appointment wasn’t on his weekend public schedule that was released Friday night, and his last physical was in February. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the 73-year-old Trump was “anticipating a very busy 2020” and wanted to take advantage of “a free weekend” in Washington to begin “portions of his routine” checkup. She was not more specific about the testing. The February checkup showed he had put on some pounds and was now officially considered obese. His Body Mass Index was 30.4. His weight was 243 pounds and he was 6 feet, 3 inches tall. Mr. Trump spent more than four hours at Walter Reed on Feb. 8 for his most recent checkup, supervised by Dr. Sean P Conley, his physician, and involving a panel of 11 specialists. “I am happy to announce the President of the United States is in very good health and I anticipate he will remain so for the duration of his Presidency, and beyond,” Dr. Conley wrote afterward. Test results came out six days later, showing that he weighed 243 pounds, compared with 236 pounds in September 2016 before he became President. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under the commonly used formula. About 40 percent of Americans are obese. That raises their risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and some forms of cancer. Mr. Trump doesn’t drink alcohol or smoke. His primary form of exercise is golf.	https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/donald-trump-undergoes-health-check-up-964736.html	0.9720622301101685	White House: Trump having tests as part of medical checkup	US President Donald Trump is undergoing medical tests as part of what the White House said was his annual check-up.

https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/johnsons-brexit-would-be-thatcherism-on-steroids-says-corbyn	Labour leader accuses prime minister of hijacking EU exit to slash workers’ rights Jeremy Corbyn is to accuse Boris Johnson of seeking to “hijack” Britain’s exit from the EU in order to unleash “Thatcherism on steroids” by slashing workers’ rights and throwing the NHS open to US corporations. With Labour’s stance on Brexit under intense scrutiny, Corbyn will promise an audience in the leave-supporting Tory-held seat of Harlow, Essex, on Tuesday that he will “get Brexit sorted” within six months. Labour is again trying to appeal to both leavers and remainers at this election by promising another referendum – but declining to say how a Labour government would campaign in it. Corbyn will be introduced by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who will explain how the party plans to renegotiate a Brexit deal within three months, which Labour says would then put to the public in a referendum by next June. Starmer is among those who had pushed for Labour to announce that it would campaign for remain in that vote – but that view did not prevail at the party’s conference in September, and Corbyn insisted on Sunday: “The debate is over.” Many Labour MPs in remain-supporting constituencies fear that the more ardently pro-remain Liberal Democrats could benefit at their expense. The Labour leader’s address in Harlow will be his second major speech since the election was announced. Corbyn is to say: “A vote for Johnson’s Conservatives is a vote to betray our NHS in a sell-out to Trump. Johnson’s Trump-deal Brexit puts a price tag on our NHS. So we’ll say it again and again until the message gets through to the White House: our NHS is not for sale.” Johnson has highlighted the UK’s ability to strike free trade deals with non-EU countries, including the US, as a key benefit of his Brexit agreement over Theresa May’s, although Trump himself has raised doubts about that. The prime minister’s deal also shifted assurances about labour laws and environmental standards from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement into the non legally-binding political declaration. Corbyn will warn that means the government is preparing to slash workers’ rights. “What Boris Johnson’s Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids,” he will say. “Margaret Thatcher’s attack on the working people of our country left scars that have never healed and communities that have never recovered. “The Conservatives know they can’t win support for what they’re planning to do in the name of Thatcherism. So they’re trying to do it under the banner of Brexit instead.” Labour knows Brexit will be a key issue in the election on 12 December, but Corbyn is also seeking to shift the agenda on to other issues, including the climate emergency. Johnson has insisted he is the party leader who will “get Brexit done”, with the “oven-ready” Brexit deal he struck in Brussels last month. The prime minister wrote to Corbyn on Monday night, accusing the Labour leader of failing to make clear what his policy was on Brexit. “Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends, and instead negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch,” Johnson wrote. “Even assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do – under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: what would your supposed Brexit ‘deal’ actually take back control of?” He challenged Corbyn to rule out supporting revoking article 50 to cancel Brexit if the general election resulted in a hung parliament and Labour entered negotiations with the Lib Dems. Jo Swinson’s party has said it would revoke article 50 if it formed a majority government.	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-corbyn-idUSKBN1XF1C3	0.9064991474151611	Johnson's Brexit would be Thatcherism on steroids, says Corbyn	HARLOW, England (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday of seeking to hijack Brexit to unleash a Thatcherite bonfire of regulation that would usher in what he cast as a much harsher brand of American-style capitalism. Britain is heading toward a deeply unpredictable Christmas election on Dec. 12 that could decide the fate of both its planned departure from the European Union and the future of the world’s fifth-largest economy. Corbyn, a 70-year old socialist campaigner, is proposing an overthrow of what he casts as a venal elite led by Johnson which he says wants to use Brexit as a Trojan horse to turn the United Kingdom into a deregulated paradise for global capital. He invoked the memory of late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and said Johnson wanted to strike a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump that would sell off parts of the National Health Service (NHS). “What Boris Johnson’s Conservatives want is to hijack Brexit to unleash Thatcherism on steroids,” Corbyn told supporters in Harlow, a suburb northeast of London which voted strongly in favor of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum. The nationwide margin was 52%-48% in favor of Leave. “A vote for Johnson’s Conservatives is a vote to betray our NHS in a sell-out to Trump,” he said, to chants of “not for sale, not for sale” from the audience. “They want a race to the bottom in standards and protections. They want to move us toward a more deregulated American model of how to run the economy.” “Iron Lady” Thatcher radically transformed the British economy along free-market lines but was hated by some voters for crushing the trade unions and privatizing swathes of industry. Johnson has repeatedly said the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks. One of his most senior ministers, Michael Gove, said Corbyn’s assertion that American drug companies could carve up parts of the NHS was “the most ridiculous nonsense I have ever heard in my 52 years on this earth”. Last week, Trump, who has previously said everything should be negotiable in trade talks, denied Labour’s claims that the NHS would be up for grabs. After rejecting calls from many senior Labour figures to take a definitive position against leaving the EU, Corbyn is focused on underscoring Johnson’s failure to deliver on his promise of Brexit on Oct. 31 and the need to get on and tackle domestic issues such as a shortage of affordable housing. Corbyn, whose party is trailing the Conservatives in opinion polls, hopes to turn the debate from whether Brexit should happen to what kind of country Britain will be, regardless of how it resolves its relationship with the EU. “People sometimes accuse me of trying to talk to both sides at once in the Brexit debate; to people who voted leave and remain. You know what? They’re right. Why would I only want to talk to half the country?” he said. “It’s Labour that’s determined to bring a divided country together.” Corbyn says if elected he would negotiate a new deal with the EU that would keep Britain more closely aligned economically with the bloc and do more to protect workers. He would then put it to the people in another referendum. He has promised to “get Brexit sorted” within six months, a deadline he said on Tuesday was “realistic”. “I am confident that such a deal can be secured and secured quickly. That deal will then be put to a referendum with Remain as the other option,” said the party’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, who is more overtly in favor of staying in the EU. “Under a Labour government: Remain will be on the ballot paper.” Johnson says Labour’s policy, which includes the possibility of campaigning against its own Brexit deal in a second referendum, is too vague and creates more uncertainty. A YouGov poll published on Tuesday found 65% of voters were unclear about Labour’s Brexit position. “Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one,” Johnson said in a letter to Corbyn late on Monday, which listed five Brexit questions he wanted Corbyn to answer. “Now the time has come for you to come clean and explain what your plan really is.”	Labour's Corbyn brands UK PM Johnson's Brexit plans 'Thatcherism on steroids'	OK	The same thread	0000d066b0--5ec6f47f42ad2815cf94bfa9	infinite	infinite

The BBC sports presenter and his partner Katya Jones saw off competition from Catherine Tyldesley , Viscountess Weymouth and David James in the head-to-head deciding dances in previous weeks. But this time, the Strictly Come Dancing judges opted to save Michelle Visage and her partner Giovanni Pernice, who danced an American smooth. Bushell, 53, failed to impress with his paso doble on Saturday night, with Bruno Tonioli saying he ""felt something"" following the matador-inspired routine, before adding: ""It was indigestion."" Despite his exit, Bushell said he was ""not going to stop dancing"", adding that the experience has ""changed me completely"". ""I have lost a stone-and-a-half. I'm a guy in his 50s, I'm mentally sharper, I feel able to deal with pressured situations thanks to the dance-offs!,"" he said.   He added: ""I didn't think I'd get this far so I have already booked a hotel in Blackpool for next weekend's show, so I'm still coming along."" The BBC Breakfast sports host praised ""amazing teacher"" Jones for making ""you believe that anything is possible"" and for performing ""miracles"". Jones said her partner ""can leave with your head held up"" adding: ""I'm so sorry I couldn't take you to Blackpool."" Judges opted to save RuPaul's Drag Race judge Visage but Bushell was also praised for ""putting up a very good fight"". Anneka Rice, James Cracknell and Dev Griffin have also been voted off the BBC One show, while Will Bayley had to withdraw following an injury.

The Russian professional dancer, 30, split from her husband and co-star Neil Jones, 37, earlier this year after six years of marriage and 11 years together. On Sunday night, she and celebrity partner Mike Bushell, 53, were axed from the show after the BBC sports presenter failed to deliver during a dance-off against Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice. Jones applauded Bushell’s resolve, after he ended up in the bottom two for the third week running. However, she admitted she had suffered at the hands of trolls. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: “You (Bushell) were absolutely brilliant about it and, no matter what, he came in every Monday smiling and just like ‘Right, I have got to put another fight on.’ “He was absolutely brilliant. And, of course, there has been in the beginning quite a few… there were hard days, wasn’t it? “Just people saying things. So I just deleted the Twitter and that was brilliant after that. “When it’s not in front of you it doesn’t exist so I just got rid of it.” Neil Jones was forced to miss two live shows because of an injury, and fellow professional Kevin Clifton stepped in to dance with former Lioness Alex Scott. Bushell, who often presents sport on BBC Breakfast on Fridays and at weekends, said viewers would have to wait a little longer before he returned to their screens. He said he intended to keep dancing and had work to do before embarking on the show’s live tour. He said: “I’m still not going to be on Breakfast for a long time. “The Strictly journey for now is not really over because we have to all go back for the Christmas special and the final. We have to learn group dances for the final. “I have got to keep training because the tour starts in January and it’s four weeks on the road where we are doing two dances plus three group dances. “So I can’t let up now. I have to keep in this shape, keep dancing, I’m going to be practising while Katya is in Blackpool. Well, I will be supporting in Blackpool. “Any moment I have got I will be trying to keep those dances in my head.” He added: “I will definitely be signing up to the local group.” However, he joked that the teachers there might not be up to “Katya’s standard”.

https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/anthem-getting-complete-overhaul-bioware-rumor/	BioWare is revamping Anthem, according to a report. Sources speaking with Kotaku have said Anthem is getting a complete overhaul. According to the report, the studio has dubbed it as Anthem 2.0 or Anthem Next. The studio is apparently working to “drastically” changing loot,  he world, and mission structure. According to one source, the team has spent a few months “tearing it down and figuring out what needed to change fundamentally,” and rebuilding for months afterward. At present, the studio has yet to decide whether the changes will be released at once or over a specific time period. BioWare has said in the past, more than once, it was working on long-term changes to the game, but wasn’t ready to discuss said changes. It did, however, state core issues with the game would be addressed.	https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/15/20966991/anthem-launch-patch-update-remake-anthem-next-20-pc-ps4-xbox-one-bioware-ea	0.9068117737770081	Anthem is getting a major overhaul at BioWare – report	BioWare is working to overhaul and redeploy Anthem — potentially as an all-new product on shelves — according to a Kotaku report quoting anonymous sources at the studio. EA itself declined to comment on the story. The salvage operation hints at the present state of the multiplayer loot-shooter, which has seen big-name project managers depart recently, and was dumped into the EA Access catalog seven months after its February launch. Still, “Anthem 2.0,” or “Anthem Next,” as it is reportedly being informally referred to, will deliver a “drastically” changed game, involving the mission structure, loot and world itself, according to Kotaku’s Jason Schreier. Anthem launched in almost complete dysfunction, with performance problems and a bland design that failed to deliver on the game’s marketing hype. Kotaku also detailed the manifold problems in Anthem’s conception and development back in April, which drew a very defensive reply from BioWare and Electronic Arts. Not soon after, BioWare began backtracking on an ambitious 90-day roadmap of post-launch support that developers had drawn up. That delayed, by three months, the release of Cataclysm, end-game content that is a staple of the open-world, massively multiplayer loot shooters that Anthem was meant to compete with. Cataclysm finally arrived in August, but failed to energize the game’s remaining player base. Kotaku’s report cautions that “many of the details are still in flux, and there’s no clear timeline” for Anthem’s makeover, whatever it entails. Developers are considering a series of updates similar to what was seen with No Man’s Sky, which struggled during its launch in 2016, but recovered in 2018 with a comprehensive update called No Man’s Sky Next. BioWare could also release “Anthem 2.0” as an entirely new game, Kotaku reported, though it’s unlikely that original Anthem owners would be forced to purchase the game again. Still “It’s safe to say that Anthem won’t suddenly transform into a brand-new franchise,” Kotaku says. “BioWare’s plan is to zoom out and overhaul the gameplay systems that most have agreed don’t work.” Kotaku, of course, has a lot more detail; you should check it out.

https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/softbanks-yahoo-japan-confirms-merger-talks-line-shares-jump	TOKYO (Nov 14): SoftBank's Yahoo Japan, one of Japan's top internet firms, confirmed it is in talks to merge with Line Corp, a US$27 billion union that would bring the messaging app operator under the SoftBank umbrella as it expands e-commerce and payments services. Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings, said on Thursday discussions were underway with Line but nothing had been decided. SoftBank Corp, which owns almost half of Z Holdings, also acknowledged the talks. Shares in Z Holdings, which had a stock market value of about US$17 billion at Wednesday's close, jumped 16%. Shares in Line, which is valued at about US$10 billion, were untraded with a glut of buy orders. Sources told Reuters the previous day a deal was likely by month-end and could see SoftBank Corp and Line's parent Naver Corp form a 50/50 venture that would control Z Holdings, which would in turn operate Line and Yahoo. Line said in a statement it was true it is considering ways to improve its corporate value but nothing had been decided. A deal would bring together the operators of two of Japan's biggest QR code payment apps, as the country belatedly shifts to cashless payments. SoftBank's PayPay recently hit 19 million users through aggressive marketing, while Line Pay can tap the 82 million Japanese users of the Line app. Those services are money-losing, with Line — which last year sold a majority stake in its mobile unit to SoftBank — reporting three consecutive quarters of operating losses as it tries to jump-start growth. While the two companies combined revenues would exceed rival Rakuten Inc, whose shares fell 6% on the news, their combined transaction value would still be dwarfed by Rakuten, Goldman Sachs analyst Masaru Sugiyama wrote in a note. SoftBank is making a major push into online retailing, launching PayPay Mall, as it tries to grow revenues outside its core telecoms business. Seperately on Thursday, Z Holdings said it has successfully acquired 50.1% of fashion e-tailer Zozo Inc in a US$3.7 billion deal announced in September, as it bulks up against rivals such as Amazon.com. The deal leaves Zozo founder and former CEO Yusaku Maezawa as the second largest shareholder with an 18% stake. Dealmaking by SoftBank Corp, controlled by tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp, comes despite the weak performance of the technology bets of its parent, which recorded an US$8.9 billion operating loss in the second quarter. The group's first quarterly loss in 14 years followed a collapse in the value of its investment in office-sharing firm WeWork as investors have turned sceptical about the path to profitability at cash-burning startups.	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-display-results-idUSKBN1XN0JW	0.8847916126251221	SoftBank's Yahoo Japan confirms merger talks with Line, shares jump	TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display reported on Wednesday an 11th consecutive quarterly net loss on sluggish display sales and restructuring costs as the cash-strapped company scrambles to clinch a bailout deal with Apple Inc and other investors. The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 25.4 billion yen ($233 million) in the July-September quarter, wider than the 7.8 billion loss a year earlier. Japan Display, money-losing for the past five years due to slowing Apple iPhone sales and the delayed adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, did not give a full-year earnings outlook. But CEO Minoru Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, told an earnings briefing the company turned profitable in October. Japan Display is seeking to raise at least 50 billion yen ($470 million), having had to scramble after Chinese investment firm Harvest suddenly pulled out of a bailout plan. Of the planned bailout funds, Apple intends to invest $200 million, sources with direct knowledge of the talks have said. Hong Kong-based Oasis Management is likely to contribute $150-180 million, Japan Display has said. Concerns about an immediate cash shortfall have been allayed as Apple has agreed to shorten payment periods, a source familiar with the matter said.

https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/liverpool-transfer-news-real-madrid-rodrygo-a9194491.html	Liverpool‘s stellar attacking line has been one of the keys behind their success over the last couple of years, reaching two Champions League finals, winning one and adding the European Super Cup to their honours list, too. This season they top the Premier League, unbeaten, and will compete in seven competitions over the course of the campaign – an indication of the strength and quality of Jurgen Klopp‘s squad. It might even have looked a little stronger, though, had they got their way with one target a couple of years ago: Rodrygo Goes, the 18-year-old Brazilian who is now shining with Real Madrid. The Spanish side agreed a deal with Rodrygo’s club Santos back in summer 2018, for a move the following year. Now, just four months after joining, he already has a Champions League hat-trick for Los Blancos and scored his first league goal for the club just one minute after coming on as sub for his debut. At least two years earlier, though, it was Liverpool who came calling. Speaking to ESPN Brazil, former Manchester City attacking midfielder Elano – then the caretaker manager at Santos who called Rodrygo up to the first team - has explained how the Reds tried to negotiate a deal for the youngster. “There was a period when there was very strong interest from Liverpool for him to leave when he was still at [the Academy] base,” Elano said. “The values ​​were very low, but they wanted to have a go. Real’s offer afterwards was around €30m more! “I had a conversation with the staff and said the boy was worth the bet [to keep hold of] and we should raise him because I would like to work with him. Thankfully everything worked out for Rodrygo’s benefit!” Elano’s words would suggest Liverpool tried to sign Rodrygo for around €10-15 million (£8-13m), given Real paid between €40-45 million for his signature. The Reds would have been attempting to sign him in early 2017 at the latest, possibly before, as he debuted for Santos in November of that year. Liverpool weren’t the only club aware of him even at that stage, of course; Barcelona thought they had a deal wrapped up for him after Real Madrid concluded a deal for Vinicius Jr, while Juventus were also credited with an interest.	https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-backed-win-premier-league-20852827	0.8893780708312988	Liverpool negotiated to sign Real Madrid starlet Rodrygo before Brazilian’s big-money move to LaLiga	"Liverpool have been given the backing of Brazilian legend Cafu to win their first Premier League title this season. The Reds haven't won a domestic league crown since 1990 but have finished runners-up twice - including last year when they were a single point behind champions Manchester City . This time around they have gone off quickly and currently boast a five point advantage at the summit of the Premier League - although face nemesis City on Sunday.

Cafu has pin-pointed Roberto Firmino's improvements as one of the keys behind Liverpool's title charges. Brazil international Firmino has become a vital cog in the Reds' front three alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Firmino has netted 69 goals in 209 appearances for the Merseyside club since joining from Hoffenheim four years ago. “Firmino can help a lot as he has been on the rise and really grown as a player in Liverpool,"" Cafu added. “He is in a period that he is on fire and constantly growing with the team. Firmino is a great player. He can play either side and has powerful contact with the ball in any position. “Today we can say that Firmino is one of the better players in the world. The difference in his game on the field is noticeable to all. Firmino is also admired for his assistance on the field. “What Jurgen Klopp has done is bring the team together with a very strong presence and powerful position on the field.”"	Liverpool backed to win Premier League title as Cafu hails Roberto Firmino	BAD	Different threads	0000d066b0--5ec6f47f42ad2815cf94bfae	infinite	infinite

He made a mess of the 16th hole Friday and escaped with bogey after hitting three tee shots (only two of them counted). He bounced back with a 5-iron to 3 feet for eagle on the final hole for a 5-under 67, leaving him one shot behind Matt Fitzpatrick. McIlroy is happy with what he has done this year. But as he stood beneath the clubhouse at Sheshan International, he shared another number that makes him proud. ""I have top 10s in 50% of my PGA Tour starts,"" McIlroy said. ""To me, that's a nice stat to know that most times you tee it up, you maybe not contend, but you're putting yourself there."" He was rounding off figures, but it's no less impressive. McIlroy, who is wrapping up his 12th full year as a pro, has finished in the top 10 in 49% of his PGA Tour starts. Tiger Woods is at 55%, while Phil Mickelson is at 32%. Dustin Johnson, who turned pro about the same time as McIlroy and already has 20 titles on the PGA Tour, is at 37%. McIlroy looked up his record because it's what drives him. Winning, sure, but that starts with chances. He has another one in Shanghai. Fitzpatrick played bogey-free in the second round for a 67 that put him at 11-under 133. He figured to drop a shot on the 16th after a bad drive and a good idea that went bad. He hooked his tee shot toward the trees and did well to get the ball to the back of the green, facing a tough lie with the ball nestled in deep rough. Fitzpatrick thought about chipping a 7-wood, blading a wedge or stabbing at it with his putter. He went with the third option. ""The putter went past the ball, and the ball was still in the air -- very weird,"" Fitzpatrick said. It rolled out onto the green and caught a slope away from the cup. No matter. He holed the long par putt, hit 5-iron to 15 feet for birdie on the tough par-3 17th and got up-and-down from the fairway on the par-5 closing hole for the 36-hole lead. Defending champion Xander Schauffele, still struggling with remnants of the flu, rallied for a 69 and was two shots behind, along with Adam Scott (69) and Sungjae Im (69). Li Haotong of China lost ground with a 72, but he remained in the mix at three shots behind. The top eight players going into the weekend came from eight countries. Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., (73) dropped 13 spots into a tie for 20th at 4 under. Adam Hadwin of Abbotsford, B.C., (77) struggled for a second straight round and was at 7 over. McIlroy ran off four straight birdies on the front, only for his momentum to slow. And then he was happy to only lose one shot on the 16th hole, which measures 288 yards. McIlroy hit 3-wood so wild to the left in the trees that he hit a provisional -- a 6-iron this time -- for a lost ball. He found it. But he realized that by taking a penalty for an unplayable lie, getting back to the fairway would have been harder than going back to the tee. So, he hit a third tee shot, a lob wedge to 8 feet and one putt for a bogey. ""I tried to hit the same shot as yesterday, but the wind was more off the left,"" McIlroy said. ""I knew I had to caress one a little bit, and I caressed it dead left. Made a good 5."" Schauffele is moderately shocked to be in the mix considering how badly he has felt this week, often turning to cough into the crook of his elbow after hitting shots. He couldn't find the fairway and limited the damage with his short game on the front nine, then cleaned it up on the back nine with three birdies. No one has won back-to-back in the HSBC Champions since it became a World Golf Championship in 2009, and Schauffele might be the best bet extending an American streak of seven victories in this series. ""I was 1 over on the front nine and was not looking like a real golfer -- or at least a professional golfer -- on that front stretch,"" Schauffele said. ""Happy that my feet got under me on the back nine, and just sort of had a little bit of a better time."" Im, looking more and more like a pick for the Presidents Cup next week, was around the lead all day until a bogey from the bunker on the 17th and failing to make birdie on the 18th.

https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/11/15/hong-kongs-biggest-music-festival-cancelled-over-political-unrest/	Clockenflap, Hong Kong’s biggest music festival, has been cancelled, organisers said on Friday, the highest-profile event so far to fall victim to the increasingly violent political unrest engulfing the city. British folk-rock sensations Mumford & Sons and American star Halsey were among the headliners for the festival this year, which was scheduled for November 22-24. “Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled,” the organisers said in a statement. “Until this week we were fully committed to delivering the festival. Unfortunately, the situation has now made this impossible.” Pro-democracy protests have escalated in the past week with widespread travel chaos wrought by roadblocks and targeted vandalism of metro stations and lines. Violent clashes between police and protesters have left parts of the city debris-strewn. Last Friday, a 22-year-old student died from head injuries sustained during a fall as police skirmished with demonstrators. And on Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick. Clockenflap is an annual festival that takes place in front of Hong Kong’s iconic harbour and attracts tens of thousands of fans. It is the latest in a growing list of banned, cancelled or postponed events in Hong Kong’s normally packed social calendar. Hong Kong’s annual pride parade due on Saturday was downgraded to a stationary rally after police banned the traditionally boisterous and colourful march. The WTA Hong Kong Open, Oxfam’s annual trail run fundraiser as well as concerts by acclaimed K-Pop acts and comedians have been pulled as the city reels from the protests. – AFP	https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/11/08/hong-kong-students-death-triggers-fresh-outrage/	0.8847951889038086	Hong Kong’s biggest music festival cancelled over political unrest	by Yan Zhao and Su Xinqi A Hong Kong student who sustained head injuries when he fell during clashes with police died on Friday, triggering a fresh wave of outrage from the pro-democracy movement and fears of more violent unrest. Although the precise chain of events leading to 22-year-old Alex Chow’s fall are unclear and disputed, his death is the first student fatality during five months of demonstrations. Protesters, who have made alleged police brutality one of their movement’s rallying cries, responded to Chow’s death with tearful vigils on Friday night and calls for fresh rallies over the weekend. “Today we mourn the loss of a freedom fighter in Hong Kong,” Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy campaigner, said on Twitter. “The atmosphere in Hong Kong is like a ticking bomb,” added Lo Kin-hei, a local pro-democracy councillor and activist. “HKers don’t trust the police will give us the truth.” Police have repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing in relation to Chow’s death. The lead officer in the case, Superintendent Ewing Wu, again insisted on Friday that police were not at fault. “As for the allegations that police chased the deceased or that we pushed him and caused him to fall, the police hereby make a solemn statement again that nothing of the kind happened,” Wu told reporters. Chow was taken to hospital early on Monday morning following clashes between police and protesters in the middle-class district of Tseung Kwan O. He was certified dead by the hospital on Friday morning after failing to emerge from a coma. Chow had been found lying unconscious in a pool of blood inside a multi-storey car park that police had fired tear gas towards. Protesters had been hurling objects from the building, in the type of confrontation that has become routine in late-night rallies over recent months. By Friday evening, the car park had become a makeshift memorial with hundreds lining up to lay flowers, light candles and stick multi-coloured notes carrying messages on the wall. “I think there should be an independent inquiry commission to investigate his death and other incidents happened during the movement,” a 23-year-old student, who gave her surname Ho and said she attended Chow’s university, told AFP. Police have acknowledged that tear gas had been used Sunday night to disperse protesters near the car park where Chow fell. Wu, the lead investigator, confirmed on Friday that police entered the car park twice to contain the protesters but said that officers were not inside when Chow fell. Wu and a police spokeswoman also rejected accusations that officers delayed paramedics getting to the scene. “At this stage, we are investigating the cause of Chow’s death instead of investigating police officers,” Wu said. The Hong Kong government expressed “great sorrow and regret” on Friday over Chow passing away. In Beijing, foreign affairs ministry Geng Shuang declined to comment directly when asked about Chow’s death. “This isn’t a diplomatic question so I suggest you ask the relevant government department. I will just say this: stopping the violence, eliminating disorder, and restoring order is Hong Kong’s most urgent task,” Geng told reporters. Chow was a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The college held its graduation ceremony Friday morning, and university head Wei Shyy paused the proceedings to announce Chow’s death. After the ceremony was cut short, hundreds of students gathered to mourn Chow’s passing and condemn what they described as police brutality. “Hindering rescuers is attempted murder!” Student chanted as they marched at the campus. Shyy later released a statement to students backing calls for an independent inquiry. “We will be outraged if there is no acceptable explanation offered to us,” he wrote. Millions of people have taken to Hong Kong’s streets since June in the greatest challenge to China’s rule of the city since its handover from the British in 1997. China governs Hong Kong under a special “one country, two systems” framework that is meant to give the city more freedoms and liberties than on the mainland. But public anger has been building for years over a belief that Beijing is eroding those freedoms, especially since President Xi Jinping came to power. The protests were triggered by a government effort to introduce a law allowing extraditions of criminal suspects to mainland China. Hong Kong’s government belatedly withdrew the plan but not before the protest movement escalated into wider calls for democracy. Protesters are demanding fully free elections to choose the city’s leader, as well as an investigation into alleged abuses by police. – AFP	Hong Kong student’s death triggers fresh outrage	BAD	Different threads	0000d066b0--5ec6f47f42ad2815cf94bfb1	infinite	infinite
https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/vic/2019/11/14/dale-ewins-zita-sukys-swingers/	Two partygoers who were dressed like punk icon Sid Vicious and a naughty schoolgirl when they were shot by police in a Melbourne nightclub will receive seven-figure payouts. Dale Ewins and former girlfriend Zita Sukys had sued the state of Victoria for negligence and excessive force, claiming their lives had been turned upside down by the July 2017 shooting at the Saints and Sinners erotic ball at Inflation nightclub. Heavily armed police stormed the venue after a patron reported Mr Ewins had a gun in his pants, and the pair were shot while performing a sex act. The gun was a plastic toy. Mr Ewins was shot twice in the back, tasered three times, beaten and stomped on, while Ms Sukys was shot in the leg. The trial began on Monday in the Supreme Court but the proceedings were dismissed on Wednesday after an earlier mediation session. No details of the settlement were revealed in court, but the pair will reportedly receive more than $1 million each. Ms Sukys received an apology that she was an “innocent bystander who was injured through no fault of her own in the circumstances of the case”. Inflation nightclub owner Martha Tsamis also settled with Victoria Police over the shooting. She said she was thrilled with the confidential settlement. “Sometimes cool heads come together and decide what the success of something can be, and I think maybe cool heads prevailed,” she said. “As far as I’m concerned we’ve done nothing wrong and we were prepared to fight it all the way.” Ms Tsamis also recently won a defamation case against Victoria Police over an unrelated incident. “I’m hoping it’s all going to settle down but I just think if you’re going to talk to Victoria Police you talk to them in the Supreme Court,” she said. “I’m very happy with the outcome and I just want to get on with my life and run my business.” Justice John Dixon said the resolution was “not necessarily an easy thing to do” but had saved the court considerable resources. “I thank the parties in particular for negotiations on their positions and accepting some compromise,” he said. The court had been told a critical incident response team was sent to Inflation to investigate reports of the gun. A staff member told officers he was confident it was a toy. Mr Ewins denies having pointed the toy at police during the confrontation, but police are adamant he did. Footage from the nightclub shows Mr Ewins laughing as he points the fake gun at a bartender as he buys drinks with Ms Sukys. Not long after, police with ballistic shields, batons, semi-automatic guns, tasers and a shotgun firing non-lethal bullets stormed the club. Chris Blanden QC, for the state of Victoria, said the initial report characterised Mr Ewins as “looking like a bikie with a tattoo on his forehead”. Audio from the aftermath of the shooting records Mr Ewins and Ms Sukys screaming in pain and swearing after they were shot. Outside court, Ms Sukys and Mr Ewins declined to answer questions about the case. Mr Ewins had been due to give evidence on Tuesday, but the settlement means his version of events will stay secret. Victoria Police did not comment on the outcome of the case or whether any officers were reprimanded after the incident. -with AAP	https://news.yahoo.com/clean-operation-underway-hong-kong-021715228.html	0.8846207857131958	Seven-figure payout for couple with fake gun shot by police	"1 / 22People scuffle with riot police at a shopping mall in Tai Po in Hong Kong By Donny Kwok and Jessie Pang HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong anti-government protesters crowded an upmarket shopping mall in running clashes with police on Sunday, with several suffering bloody wounds a day after parts of the Chinese-ruled city became a battleground. A human chain in Cityplaza, in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, turned into a bloody face-to-face conflict with police, running up and down escalators where families with young children had been window shopping just minutes before and watching skating on the ice rink. Police said protesters had vandalized a restaurant after a peaceful chanting of slogans. Several people were wounded, one man in a white tee-shirt being beaten with sticks by protesters. Another man lay in a pool of blood on the pavement. Media reports said a knifeman had attacked four people. Broadcaster RTHK said Democratic district councillor Andrew Chiu was among the wounded and that part of his ear had been bitten off. It was not immediately possible to verify the reports. A kitchen knife lay on the ground outside the mall. ""These police are not what they used to be,"" said Julie, 24, giving police the middle finger. ""They come in here and push us around. It is not right."" Police made several arrests as protesters shouted ""black police!"", a reference to their perceived brutality. Police fired pepper spray at reporters when they got too close. One journalist was arrested. There were also scuffles, confrontations and vandalism in malls in the New Territories towns of Tai Po, Tuen Mun and Sha Tin, where police fired pepper spray as protesters hurled abuse. Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997, battled police across the main island on Saturday, furious at Communist Party leaders in Beijing and perceived Chinese meddling with Hong Kong's freedoms, which China denies. They have vandalized Hong Kong businesses seen as being pro-China and in July daubed China's Liaison Office, the key symbol of Chinese sovereignty, with graffiti. Cleaners swept up broken glass at the Hong Kong office of China's official Xinhua news agency on Sunday, one of the buildings vandalized on the 22nd straight weekend of protests when activists hurled petrol bombs and set fire to metro stations. Xinhua condemned the attack by what it said were ""barbaric thugs"" who broke doors and security systems and threw fire and paint bombs into the lobby. ""The practice of the black rioters once again shows that 'stopping the violence and restoring order' is Hong Kong's most important and urgent task at present,"" a spokesperson for Xinhua said in a Facebook post. Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon at protesters on Saturday and early Sunday as the violence spilled from Hong Kong island across the harbor to Kowloon. One of the protesters' key demands is an independent probe into perceived police brutality. There have been several injuries during five months of unrest, including a protester shot in the chest and a policeman slashed in the neck, but no deaths since the protests began in June. Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula which guarantees its freedoms for 50 years. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has a garrison in Hong Kong but troops have remained in barracks since the protests began. Protesters last month targeted a PLA barracks with lasers prompting troops to hoist a banner warning they could be arrested. Senior PLA officers have said violence will not be tolerated. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam will fly to China this week to discuss how to make it easier for Hong Kong people to live and work on the mainland, her office said on Sunday. Lam, despised by pro-democracy protesters, will arrive in Beijing on Tuesday for a meeting the next day of the ""leading group"" for developing the Greater Bay Area of southern China. The group has already met twice, ""endorsing a number of measures to facilitate Hong Kong people to develop, work and reside in the mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area, as well as strengthen the convenient flow of people and goods"", her office said. The idea was to attract ""high-end talent"" from Hong Kong with tax breaks and encourage ""innovation and entrepreneurship"" from young people in Hong Kong and Macau. Lam has promoted the Greater Bay Area as a way to provide jobs for people in Hong Kong and ease social tension. The megalopolis of the Greater Bay Area is made up of nine mainland cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, a former Portuguese-run enclave that returned to China in 1999.

https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2019/11/02/djokovic-beats-dimitrov-to-reach-paris-masters-final/1806315	PARIS, Nov 2 — Novak Djokovic saw off Grigor Dimitrov in the Paris Masters last four today to set up a potential final against Rafael Nadal — his rival for the year-end world number one spot. Top seed Djokovic came through a dramatic first-set tie-break before prevailing 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 to move to the brink of a record-extending fifth Bercy title. The 32-year-old will face either Nadal, who can secure the end-of-year top ranking by winning the tournament, or Canadian youngster Denis Shapovalov in tomorrow’s final.

Top seed Djokovic came through a dramatic first-set tie-break before prevailing 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 to move to the brink of a record-extending fifth Bercy title. The 32-year-old will face either Nadal, who can secure the end-of-year top ranking by winning the tournament, or Canadian youngster Denis Shapovalov in Sunday's final. It will be the 50th Masters final of Djokovic's career and his sixth in Paris, having lost to Russian Karen Khachanov in last year's championship match. ""The first set, he played better,"" said Djokovic. ""It was played at a really high level. The atmosphere was incredible, especially in the tie-break."" The 16-time Grand Slam champion is bidding for his fifth title of the season ahead of the ATP Tour Finals in London, which start on November 10, where he will be hoping to equal Pete Sampras' record of finishing six years as the world number one. Djokovic leads his storied rivalry with Nadal by 28 wins to 26, and has beaten 20-year-old Shapovalov in all three of their previous meetings. Dimitrov started strongly on serve, showing the form that had taken him through the last three rounds without dropping a set, but could not force a break point as the opening set went to a tie-break. The 28-year-old claimed a mini-break to lead 5-4, but then powered a simple volley into the tramlines after a 32-shot rally. Djokovic claimed a one-set advantage, and pointed to his ear in celebration, after a brilliant 35-shot exchange on his first set point that ended with Dimitrov sending a backhand spinning long. World number 27 Dimitrov, playing in his first Masters semi-final since losing to Nadal in Monte Carlo last year, appeared to have regained his composure at the start of the second set, but was broken in the fifth game as Djokovic closed in on victory. Dimitrov managed to force his opponent to serve for a place in the final, but Djokovic did just that with his second straight hold to love."

https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/vic/2019/11/14/dale-ewins-zita-sukys-swingers/	Two partygoers who were dressed like punk icon Sid Vicious and a naughty schoolgirl when they were shot by police in a Melbourne nightclub will receive seven-figure payouts. Dale Ewins and former girlfriend Zita Sukys had sued the state of Victoria for negligence and excessive force, claiming their lives had been turned upside down by the July 2017 shooting at the Saints and Sinners erotic ball at Inflation nightclub. Heavily armed police stormed the venue after a patron reported Mr Ewins had a gun in his pants, and the pair were shot while performing a sex act. The gun was a plastic toy. Mr Ewins was shot twice in the back, tasered three times, beaten and stomped on, while Ms Sukys was shot in the leg. The trial began on Monday in the Supreme Court but the proceedings were dismissed on Wednesday after an earlier mediation session. No details of the settlement were revealed in court, but the pair will reportedly receive more than $1 million each. Ms Sukys received an apology that she was an “innocent bystander who was injured through no fault of her own in the circumstances of the case”. Inflation nightclub owner Martha Tsamis also settled with Victoria Police over the shooting. She said she was thrilled with the confidential settlement. “Sometimes cool heads come together and decide what the success of something can be, and I think maybe cool heads prevailed,” she said. “As far as I’m concerned we’ve done nothing wrong and we were prepared to fight it all the way.” Ms Tsamis also recently won a defamation case against Victoria Police over an unrelated incident. “I’m hoping it’s all going to settle down but I just think if you’re going to talk to Victoria Police you talk to them in the Supreme Court,” she said. “I’m very happy with the outcome and I just want to get on with my life and run my business.” Justice John Dixon said the resolution was “not necessarily an easy thing to do” but had saved the court considerable resources. “I thank the parties in particular for negotiations on their positions and accepting some compromise,” he said. The court had been told a critical incident response team was sent to Inflation to investigate reports of the gun. A staff member told officers he was confident it was a toy. Mr Ewins denies having pointed the toy at police during the confrontation, but police are adamant he did. Footage from the nightclub shows Mr Ewins laughing as he points the fake gun at a bartender as he buys drinks with Ms Sukys. Not long after, police with ballistic shields, batons, semi-automatic guns, tasers and a shotgun firing non-lethal bullets stormed the club. Chris Blanden QC, for the state of Victoria, said the initial report characterised Mr Ewins as “looking like a bikie with a tattoo on his forehead”. Audio from the aftermath of the shooting records Mr Ewins and Ms Sukys screaming in pain and swearing after they were shot. Outside court, Ms Sukys and Mr Ewins declined to answer questions about the case. Mr Ewins had been due to give evidence on Tuesday, but the settlement means his version of events will stay secret. Victoria Police did not comment on the outcome of the case or whether any officers were reprimanded after the incident. -with AAP	https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/vic/2019/11/15/zita-sukys-swinger-shooting/	0.9048624634742737	Seven-figure payout for couple with fake gun shot by police	A victim of the Victoria Police shooting at an erotic nightclub party has called the officers who fired on her and her then boyfriend “criminals”. Zita Sukys was wounded when she and her then-partner Dale Ewins were sprayed with bullets while they were engaged in a sex act at the Inflation nightclub in Melbourne in July 2017. Police say they were called to reports of a man with a gun, but Mr Ewins was carrying a $2 toy. “I still can’t sleep at night,” Ms Sukys told The Age newspaper on Friday. “A payout isn’t going to make me feel safe. The shooters are still out there and are criminals in my eyes.” A Supreme Court trial accusing the state of Victoria of negligence and excessive force was settled this week. A reported $3 million payout will be divided between Mr Ewins, Ms Sukys and club owner Martha Tsamis. Ms Sukys also received an official apology stating that she was an “innocent bystander who was injured through no fault of her own in the circumstances of the case”. The case was settled just before Mr Ewins was to give evidence, meaning his version of events will stay secret. Ms Tsamis said on Thursday that “maybe cool heads [had] prevailed”. “As far as I’m concerned we’ve done nothing wrong and we were prepared to fight it all the way,” she said. Victoria Police said on Thursday it would finally investigate the actions of its officers, none of whom have yet been reprimanded. “The finding made in regards to this was that they (officers) acted in self-defence,” Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said on Thursday. “We will now open up that investigation file again and look at all of the facts, if there is anything additional that may give cause to alter that, or review it.” Mr Ewins has emphatically denied pointing the gun at police and CCTV footage of the heavily-armed officers swarming through the nightclub and opening fire is inconclusive. Mr Ewins and Ms Sukys were dressed like punk icon Sid Vicious and a naughty schoolgirl at the nightclub’s Saints and Sinners party. Mr Ewins was shot twice in the back, tasered three times, beaten and stomped on, while Ms Sukys was shot in the leg. Victoria’s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission slammed police for not investigating its officers. “Victoria Police only investigated the conduct of the patrons involved in this incident, and not the actions and conduct of police officers,” IBAC Commissioner Robert Redlich QC said on Thursday. Mr Patton said police were waiting for the civil lawsuit to finish before doing their own review, but Mr Redlich said that wasn’t an excuse. “That was not an appropriate reason for not undertaking the necessary review,” Mr Redlich said. -with AAP	Police nightclub shooting victim ‘can’t sleep at night’	BAD	Different threads	0000d066b0--5ec6f47f42ad2815cf94bfb4	infinite	infinite
https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/schoolgirl-was-on-ride-without-teacher-drayton-manor-theme-park-inquest-told-961746.html	An 11-year-old girl who drowned after falling into 12ft of water at Drayton Manor theme park in the UK was allowed aboard the river rapids ride without a teacher, an inquest heard. Evha Jannath was “propelled” from a six-seater vessel on Splash Canyon on May 9 2017, while on an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girls’ Academy in Leicester. An inquest heard Evha and other pupils on the circular vessel had been repeatedly standing up, and “reaching into the water”, against the rules, before it struck a barrier, sending her head-first into the water. Evha and four friends boarded the boat without a teacher after the member of staff allocated to look after them stayed with another pupil who did not want to go on the ride. The inquest at Stafford’s County Buildings was told by Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, how Evha – who was unable to swim – initially fell into water up to her thighs. Appearing uninjured, she was then shown on CCTV wading along the edge of the ride route, towards the exit platform, trying to get back to her friends. Her schoolmates were shouting back towards Evha while another member of the public stood at the ride course’s barrier a few feet above told her to “stop” where she was. The youngster, who was still in the water, carried on wading and then attempted to climb the ride’s “travelator” which lifts the ride vessels up out of the water, to an exit platform. But as she climbed the “algae-covered” wooden planks on the mechanism, she fell off the side into a “much deeper” area of water at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire. After pupils and members of the public raised the alarm, theme park staff rushed to the ride and began a search. Some 11 minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, Evha was spotted “face down”. It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as “lifeless”. Despite CPR being administered at the scene and advanced life support by air ambulance medics, she was pronounced dead less that two hours later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Opening an inquest into her death on Monday, assistant coroner for South Staffordshire Margaret Jones said Evha and her friends had been on the ride “without incident” accompanied by teachers, earlier that day. The hearing was told that according to the theme park’s ride height restrictions, Evha was allowed aboard the vessel without an adult. A signed risk assessment prepared by the school before the trip stated that a member of staff would be “allocated” to groups of five or six primary age pupils, like Evha, while the older secondary age pupils could supervise themselves. DI Quilty said: “The member of staff allocated to Evha and her group remained at exit and did not join her group and her intention was to meet children as they came off exit.” Meanwhile, three other member of staff boarded a different vessel, travelling four boats behind Evha’s. A member of the theme park ride staff said he observed the “good behaviour” of Evha and her friends boarding their vessel. But CCTV showed that as soon as the ride begun, Evha and some of the other girls were leaving their seats and not keeping hold of the safety rail. DI Quilty, who led an investigation into the incident, said: “At no point do we actually see her sat (in her seat) on the ride.” Describing the moment the youngster was ejected from the vessel, he said: “Evha is sat out of the seats, in the gap (between the seats). “She is sat down at this point in time, and when the boat makes contact (with the barrier) – at the worst possible time – she stands up and, as a result of the propulsion and force of the barrier, that propels her out of the vessel. “She is just standing up and as soon as she makes contact with barrier she is pushed out, there’s nothing behind her and she naturally falls out.” Dr Frances Hollingbury, a Home Office pathologist, said she had determined a cause of death of drowning, although it was initially recorded as a result of blunt force trauma to the chest. She added that although Evha suffered multiple rib fractures, possible injuries to the lungs and a broken pelvis, she “wouldn’t have expected Evha to have died as a direct result of these injuries, without complications”.

Evha and four friends had boarded the vessel without a teacher after school staff agreed to the pupils' request to go on the ride unaccompanied.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roku-stocks-idUSKBN1XH2L5	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Roku Inc’s (ROKU.O) stock tumbled 11% on Thursday after the video streaming company gave a quarterly report that Wall Street deemed not good enough to justify its sky-high valuation. A major winner in the consumer shift away from cable television in favor of Netflix (NFLX.O) and other over-the-top services, Roku’s stock remains up over 300% this year, even after Thursday’s retreat. Shares of the San Jose, California company, which reported a wider loss for the September quarter, are valued at an elevated 11 times revenue expected over the next 12 months, compared to a multiple of about 5 for streaming heavyweight Netflix, according to Refinitiv. “We applaud management for driving substantial growth on a sound business model. However, we think shares are currently overvalued and expect volatility to persist,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter warned in a client note on Thursday, maintaining his neutral rating. Roku reported a September-quarter net loss and revenue that were better than analysts on average expected, according to Refinitiv. It raised its revenue guidance while trimming its outlook for adjusted EBITDA. Competition in the streaming market is increasing rapidly, with Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Apple (AAPL.O) launching new services in November. AT&T Inc’s (T.N) HBO Max and a new offering from Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) are expected to enter the market next year. Reflecting growing competition in hardware used to deliver streaming services, Roku’s stock tumbled 28% over three days in September after Comcast said it would offer internet customers a streaming media set top box for free. As the streaming video market has become more crowded, Roku has shifted its focus from device sales to advertising, which is now the company’s fastest-growing revenue stream. At least two analysts increased their price targets for Roku following its report, while Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris cut his price target, maintaining his “buy” rating. Thirteen analysts recommend buying Roku’s stock, while four are neutral and two recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The analysts’ median price target is $150, which is 20% above Roku’s current price of $125.	https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/fitbit-sales-beat-wall-street-expectations-ahead-of-google-deal-1.1344105	0.8862338066101074	Roku tumbles 11% as Wall St. gives thumbs down to latest report	Fitbit Inc. reported revenue that beat analysts’ estimates in its first quarterly results since Google announced its planned acquisition of the wearable technology company. Third-quarter sales were US$347 million, the San Francisco-based company said Wednesday in a statement. That was a decline of 12 per cent from the period a year earlier, but ahead of analysts’ projections of US$345.1 million. The shares slipped less than 1 per cent in extended trading after closing at US$7.03 earlier on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Fitbit agreed to be acquired by Alphabet Inc.’s Google in a deal that could help shore up the internet giant’s consumer-hardware business while also increasing antitrust scrutiny. The companies expect the US$2.1 billion transaction to close sometime in 2020. “We continued to make good progress shifting our business toward the faster growing smartwatch category with the introduction of Versa 2, expanding Fitbit Health Solutions, and deepening our relationship with consumers,” James Park, chief executive officer of Fitbit, said in the statement. “The continued success of the Fitbit brand is built on the trust of our users, and our commitment to strong user privacy and security will not change,” he added. “I’m excited about the combination of Fitbit and Google and look forward to closing the transaction.”	Fitbit sales beat Wall Street expectations ahead of Google deal	BAD	Different threads	0000d066b0--5ec6f47f42ad2815cf94bfb6	infinite	infinite
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spain-rape-trial-5-men-acquitted-today-on-grounds-that-14-year-old-victim-was-unconscious-2019-11-01/	"Spaniards are voicing outrage after five men were acquitted of rape on the grounds that their 14-year-old victim had been unconscious at the time. The Barcelona-based court ruled Thursday that the men were guilty of the lesser crime of sexual abuse and sentenced them to 10-12 years and fined them 12,000 euros. It ruled that their act could not be considered sexual assault since the girl was unconscious after consuming alcohol and drugs. That meant they did not need to use violence or intimidation, a requirement for a rape conviction in Spain, the court said. Spain's deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, said that while her government does not comment on court decisions it has set as a priority a modification in the law to make clear that consent is necessary for sexual relations to occur legally. On Twitter, Barcelona's Mayor Ada Colau slammed the ""outrageous sentence,"" BBC News reported. ""I am not a judge and I do not know how many years in prison they deserve, what I do know is that it is not abuse, it is rape!"" The attack occurred in the town of Manresa, near Barcelona, in 2016 when the girl and the men went into an abandoned factory to drink. The court said that since the victim was unconscious during the attack, she ""could not accept or reject the sexual relations"" and that the men ""could carry out those sexual relations without the use of violence or intimidation."" Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau and other left-wing politicians and feminist groups have condemned the ruling, as well as clamoring for the law to be strengthened in the victims' favor. ""Another senseless verdict by the patriarchal Justice that doesn't want to understand that only a Yes means Yes,"" Colau wrote on Twitter. ""An unconscious 14-year-old girl was gang raped. I am not a judge and I don't know how many years of prison they deserve, (but) what I do know is that this is not abuse, it is rape!"" Marisa Soleto, of the feminist group Fundación Mujeres, said that ""this is just one more piece of proof for the necessity to change the penal code."" A similar 2017 ruling sparked widespread protests when five men were found guilty of sexually abusing a woman but acquitted of rape for an attack in Pamplona. Spain's Supreme Court later overruled the lower court and convicted them of rape. BBC News reports the new case is known as the ""Manada de Manresa"" - Manresa Wolf Pack - for its similarities to that case."	https://www.foxnews.com/world/spain-court-acquits-five-men-of-rape-because-no-forced-was-needed-against-unconscious-victim	0.9432320594787598	Spanish court acquits 5 men of rape on grounds that 14-year-old victim was unconscious	"Spaniards are voicing outrage after a Barcelona court ruled Thursday that five men accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old were not guilty of rape because their victim was unconscious at the time. The court ruled that the men were instead guilty of the lesser crime of sexual abuse; they were sentenced to 10 to 12 years each and fined 2,000 euros ($13,300). A conviction of sexual assault would have carried prison sentences of 15 to 20 years. The requirement for a rape conviction in Spain is the use of violence or intimidation, and since the girl was unconscious after consuming drugs and alcohol, such force was not used. Therefore, the court ruled their crime could not be considered sexual assault, the equivalent of rape in Spain. A debate is taking place over whether to define rape as sex without explicit consent. Spain’s deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, said though her government does not comment on court decisions, it has prioritized modifying the law to make it clear that consent is necessary for sexual relations to occur legally. INDONESIAN MAN WHO HELPED WRITE STRICT ADULTERY LAW PUBLICLY FLOGGED FOR AFFAIR  In 2016 the girl and the five men went into an abandoned factory to drink in the town of Manresa, near Barcelona. Two Spaniards, two Cubans and one Argentine each took their turn with the drugged and intoxicated minor. One of the defendants was said to have told each of them, “It’s your turn. Fifteen minutes each and no delay,"" according to the BBC. At a previous court hearing, the girl said she remembered very little of what happened but recalled one of them was holding a gun. All of the defendants denied the allegations, but the DNA of one of them was found on the girl’s underwear. BARCELONA PRO-INDEPENDENCE PROTESTERS CLASH AFTER MASSIVE PEACEFUL RALLY  The court said that since the victim was unconscious and “could not accept or reject the sexual relations,” the men “could carry out those sexual relations without the use of violence or intimidation.” Barcelona’s mayor and other left-wing politicians and feminist groups condemned the ruling and called on the law to be strengthened. “Another senseless verdict by the patriarchal Justice that doesn’t want to understand that only a Yes means Yes,” Mayor Ada Colau wrote on Twitter. “An unconscious 14-year-old girl was gang raped.

https://bgr.com/2019/11/14/apple-store-employee-steals-private-intimate-photo-fired/	An employee at an Apple Store in Bakersfield, California has been fired after it was discovered that he texted himself an intimate photo found on a customer’s iPhone. The story first came to light when Gloria Fuentes — who is the customer in question — posted a detailed recap of events on her Facebook page. As Fuentes recounts, she went to a nearby Apple store to get the display on her iPhone repaired. Ahead of time, Fuentes — in the interest of safety and privacy — began deleting a number of sensitive photos from her phone. Her appointment at the Apple Store, however, was pushed up by a few hours and subsequently didn’t leave her with enough time to delete everything she was intending to. After rushing over to the Apple Store, she handed her phone over to an Apple employee who — after looking at the phone for a while and asking for her passcode twice — eventually told her that she would have to address the problem via her carrier. Later in the day, Fuentes opened up her Messages app and found a curious text message sent to a number she didn’t recognize. Upon opening it up, she was horrified to discover that the Apple store employee “sent himself one of my extremely personal pictures that I took for my boyfriend and it had my geolocation on so he also knows where I live.” Fuentes makes a point of noting that the picture in question was taken nearly 12 months prior and was within a library of 5,000 pictures, which is to say that the Apple store employee must have spent a good deal of time browsing through her personal photos. Fuentes next went back to the Apple store and confronted the employee about it. He conceded that it was his number but said that “he doesnt know how that pic got sent.” Fuentes makes a good and scary point in that this may not have been the first time the Apple employee in question has done something like this. Commenting on the matter to The Washington Post, Apple said that it has since fired the employee. “We are grateful to the customer for bringing this deeply concerning situation to our attention,” a spokesperson said. “Apple immediately launched an internal investigation and determined that the employee acted far outside the strict privacy guidelines to which we hold all Apple employees. He is no longer associated with our company.” According to additional reports, local police are investigating the matter and criminal charges may be forthcoming.	https://www.techspot.com/news/82788-apple-store-worker-fired-sending-customer-intimate-photo.html	0.8834152817726135	Apple Store employee fired after stealing an intimate photo from a customer’s iPhone	As the Washington Post reports, Fuentes had an appointment on November 4 to have her iPhone screen repaired. Sensibly, she deleted all social media and financial apps beforehand and was going to remove all her photos as well, but the store brought the appointment forward a few hours, meaning she never had time. After arriving in a hurry, Fuentes gave her iPhone to an employee. He began “messing around with it for quite a while,” and asked for her passcode twice. “I didn’t really pay any mind to it because I just figured he’s doing his job, looking into my insurance info or whatever,” she wrote in a Facebook post. Once Fuentes got home, she examined her phone and noticed a text had been sent to an unknown number. When she opened the message, the truth dawned on her: the Apple worker had searched through her photos, found an intimate one, and texted it to himself. The photo was an “extremely personal” one that Fuentes took for her boyfriend. “It had my geolocation on so he (the employee) also knows where I live,” she added. Fuentes noted that the picture was taken 12 months ago and was in a library of over 5,000 images, meaning the worker must have spent a good amount of time browsing through them. When she went back to the store and confronted the man, he admitted the text was delivered to his number but didn’t know how the picture got sent. Not surprisingly, the man in question was fired by Apple. “We are grateful to the customer for bringing this deeply concerning situation to our attention,” a spokesperson said. “Apple immediately launched an internal investigation and determined that the employee acted far outside the strict privacy guidelines to which we hold all Apple employees. He is no longer associated with our company.” Fuentes said she would press charges against the man, and local police have confirmed they are continuing to investigate. Back in 2016, Apple fired staff from one of its Australian stores following allegations they were stealing intimate photos of female customers from iPhones that were in for repair.

https://theeagleonline.com.ng/osinbajo-alibaba-co-founder-discuss-opportunities-in-nigerias-digital-economy/	Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, received a delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs led by billionaire businessman and co-founder of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma. Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Chinese multinational company with investments in e-commerce, retail, Internet, and technology. Osinbajo and Ma, during their interaction, spoke on opportunities in Nigeria’s digital economy and huge population. The vice president thanked Ma for honouring the invitation he extended to him to visit Nigeria when they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to Osinbajo, Nigeria represents incredible opportunity and potential as it will, in another two decades, become the third largest in terms of population in the entire world. Osinbajo said that the Alibaba group had achieved a lot in terms of broadening the scope of business and activities for people everywhere. He said: “If there is anything you have achieved, for the politician, we say you have democratised business. “It is a great achievement and I think it is something we will like to learn from and benefit from ,especially as we open up government businesses and transactions and make them more efficient for the use of our people. “This is an exciting time for us and we are very happy that you are here and a lot of businesses and entrepreneurs are looking forward to your interacting with them later today. “I think you will find a very energetic, very creative group of young men and women and old men and women who are increasingly getting interested in entrepreneurship, especially digital entrepreneurship and I am happy to see that you have a good group of businesses from China. “I hope it will create an opportunity to start investigating business opportunities in Nigeria and I really hope that we will be able to do something and create some opportunities here.” The vice president said that Nigeria had a lot entrepreneurs and young people who were actively engaged in the digital economy. He said that the Federal Government started a job programme for young people called N-Power where half a million young people were engaged. He said that the government had to build the e-infrastructure to make the programme happen. Osinbajo said that a system was developed in which N-Power beneficiaries were paid online and online materials were put in open and accessible portals for them. He said: “They also have equipment which enables them to train as extension workers for farm; we train them to teach also using the open portal; and it has proved to tremendously successful. “We have a programme called broadband connectivity for all by 2023; which basically is to see how we can deepen connectivity across the country by 2023 and we are looking just as you said about e-government. “That is also crucial because government tend to be viewed with a great deal of suspicion; nobody is quite sure of what government is up to all the time. “I think that the government can benefit from the efficiency that digital economy provides.’’ Earlier in his remark, Ma said that Chinese entrepreneurs were bringing four `Es’ to Africa. He said that the first `e’ was e-infrastructure; to support internet connection to all parts of Africa as it hoped that every young people, every small business should have a mobile phone  to run their businesses anywhere, anytime. He said: “We hope to support e-entrepreneurs; we want to make entrepreneurs the heroes of the African continent, it is the entrepreneurs that promote business development in China; government support entrepreneur with the infrastructure they need. “If the government is on ‘e’, government will be very efficient, transparent and the people know what the government can do and the government know what the people want. “The last and very important is e-education; in the next few days, we are going to have African e-entrepreneur prize; so all the African countries can apply for our awards. “So, I am very happy to hear that four Nigerian entrepreneurs are right among the top 10; we will be in the final competition in two days and I think Nigerian entrepreneurs will have a great result. “It is just the beginning for us; our job is to support entrepreneurs because we are all entrepreneurs; we are all founders of our own businesses in China,’’ he said.

https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/schoolgirl-was-on-ride-without-teacher-drayton-manor-theme-park-inquest-told-961746.html	An 11-year-old girl who drowned after falling into 12ft of water at Drayton Manor theme park in the UK was allowed aboard the river rapids ride without a teacher, an inquest heard. Evha Jannath was “propelled” from a six-seater vessel on Splash Canyon on May 9 2017, while on an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girls’ Academy in Leicester. An inquest heard Evha and other pupils on the circular vessel had been repeatedly standing up, and “reaching into the water”, against the rules, before it struck a barrier, sending her head-first into the water. Evha and four friends boarded the boat without a teacher after the member of staff allocated to look after them stayed with another pupil who did not want to go on the ride. The inquest at Stafford’s County Buildings was told by Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Staffordshire Police, how Evha – who was unable to swim – initially fell into water up to her thighs. Appearing uninjured, she was then shown on CCTV wading along the edge of the ride route, towards the exit platform, trying to get back to her friends. Her schoolmates were shouting back towards Evha while another member of the public stood at the ride course’s barrier a few feet above told her to “stop” where she was. The youngster, who was still in the water, carried on wading and then attempted to climb the ride’s “travelator” which lifts the ride vessels up out of the water, to an exit platform. But as she climbed the “algae-covered” wooden planks on the mechanism, she fell off the side into a “much deeper” area of water at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire. After pupils and members of the public raised the alarm, theme park staff rushed to the ride and began a search. Some 11 minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, Evha was spotted “face down”. It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as “lifeless”. Despite CPR being administered at the scene and advanced life support by air ambulance medics, she was pronounced dead less that two hours later at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. Opening an inquest into her death on Monday, assistant coroner for South Staffordshire Margaret Jones said Evha and her friends had been on the ride “without incident” accompanied by teachers, earlier that day. The hearing was told that according to the theme park’s ride height restrictions, Evha was allowed aboard the vessel without an adult. A signed risk assessment prepared by the school before the trip stated that a member of staff would be “allocated” to groups of five or six primary age pupils, like Evha, while the older secondary age pupils could supervise themselves. DI Quilty said: “The member of staff allocated to Evha and her group remained at exit and did not join her group and her intention was to meet children as they came off exit.” Meanwhile, three other member of staff boarded a different vessel, travelling four boats behind Evha’s. A member of the theme park ride staff said he observed the “good behaviour” of Evha and her friends boarding their vessel. But CCTV showed that as soon as the ride begun, Evha and some of the other girls were leaving their seats and not keeping hold of the safety rail. DI Quilty, who led an investigation into the incident, said: “At no point do we actually see her sat (in her seat) on the ride.” Describing the moment the youngster was ejected from the vessel, he said: “Evha is sat out of the seats, in the gap (between the seats). “She is sat down at this point in time, and when the boat makes contact (with the barrier) – at the worst possible time – she stands up and, as a result of the propulsion and force of the barrier, that propels her out of the vessel. “She is just standing up and as soon as she makes contact with barrier she is pushed out, there’s nothing behind her and she naturally falls out.” Dr Frances Hollingbury, a Home Office pathologist, said she had determined a cause of death of drowning, although it was initially recorded as a result of blunt force trauma to the chest. She added that although Evha suffered multiple rib fractures, possible injuries to the lungs and a broken pelvis, she “wouldn’t have expected Evha to have died as a direct result of these injuries, without complications”. The inquest continues.

Evha Jannath was ""propelled"" from a six-seater vessel on Drayton Manor's Splash Canyon ride on May 9 2017, while on an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girls Academy in Leicester. An inquest at Stafford County Buildings has been told that Evha and other pupils on the circular boat had been repeatedly standing up, and ""reaching into the water"", against the rules, before it hit a barrier, sending her head-first into the water. Evha and four friends boarded the vessel without a teacher after school staff agreed to the pupils' request to go on the ride unaccompanied. The ride operator that day, Samuel Read, was sitting in the control cabin with a trainee observing. Mr Read, who had worked at the park for 10 years, said he had been trained on the attraction, including use of the emergency stop button on the control panel. Giving evidence on Tuesday, he said: ""In case of emergency, if we witness a person falling in the water, our first port of call would be to push the emergency stop button. ""If we did not witness it, but received reports, we would search the ride CCTV to see if we could see them and then contact the control room, the main hub for control of the park."" Asked how long it might take to search the nine CCTV cameras, he said ""a minute or two"". However, he later agreed that half the ride was not covered by CCTV. Charles Curtis, barrister for Evha's family, asked about the written safety operations for the ride, which said: ""If a guest should fall from a boat in any location except the station, press the emergency stop. ""From what you told the jury, I understand that in your view that is only if you have seen the person fall in the water. ""And if you haven't seen it (the fall), you try and find them on the CCTV and contact the control room? ""That is not what is written down here. It doesn't specify, 'only if you see someone fall in', but that is your understanding?""   Mr Read, who had operated the ride for five seasons, said he had ""picked up"" his ""understanding"" of when to use the emergency stop button during training. In the event, he did not turn off the water pumps that drive the boats until another staff member told him to, 10 minutes after Evha's fall was first reported to him. Earlier, Mr Read told assistant coroner Margaret Jones he had no formal training on water rescue, and no specialised marine rescue equipment had been available that day. Three weeks before the incident, ride operators had met to discuss safety measures.   Among issues identified were increasing the number of CCTV display monitors, moving the emergency stop button, and the legibility of safety signs on the boats telling customers to stay in their seats. The coroner asked: ""Can you recall any problems with the CCTV?"" Mr Read replied that the existing system of nine cameras being monitored on a single screen in the cabin made it ""quite difficult to see"", so operators had asked for extra monitors. The coroner said: ""It seems that the issue wasn't taken forward, sadly, by the time of this incident involving Evha."" Earlier, Theresa Atkinson, who had been at the park in Tamworth, Staffordshire, described seeing Evha in the water. Mrs Atkinson said: ""She looked like she was panicking and I shouted to her to stay where she was. I didn't want her to let go, I didn't know if she could swim or whether she was hurt, I didn't know anything. ""I tried to climb over the fencing to get to her, then (I was) panicking that I couldn't get my foot over the fencing."" It took her ""three to four minutes"" to run to alert park staff at the ride's photo booth, where there was a female member of staff, Hayley Dyson. Ms Dyson said she rang Mr Read after Mrs Atkinson told her to ""stop the ride, because there's someone in the water"". She said the operator replied they were ""checking the CCTV to see what's going on"" and a few minutes later she saw other staff heading to the ride. On Monday, the inquest heard that Evha attempted to climb the ride's ""travelator"" which lifts the vessels up out of the water, to an exit platform, but fell into a 12ft deep area of water. Eleven minutes after staff were alerted to Evha originally going into the water, she was spotted face down. It was another six minutes before theme park staff were able to pull her out, when she was described as ""lifeless"", and was later pronounced dead in hospital. The inquest continues."

https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/authorities-look-for-solutions-to-stubble-burning-problem-pm-reviews-pollution-situation-119110501484_1.html	"As the air quality in Delhi-NCR hovered between ""severe"" and ""very poor"" category, a top Agriculture ministry official on Tuesday mooted crop diversification and shift to a short duration paddy crop to reduce stubble burning in northern states that has been primarily blamed for pollution during winter months. The pollution situation in northern India was also reviewed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a day after the Supreme Court ordered an immediate and complete stop to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh blamed for 46 per cent of the pollution in Delhi-National Capital Region(NCR). The top court did some tough-talking and had warned that the administration at large will be made accountable even if there is a single incident of stubble burning henceforth. It issued a slew of directions that also included stopping all construction and demolition activities as well as garbage and waste burning in Delhi-NCR till further orders. As authorities considered various options to put an end to stubble burning, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said conversion of stubble to fertilisers can be a permanent solution while the National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA) called for promoting crop diversification and a shift to a short duration paddy crop. All India Bhartiya Kisan Union Coordinator Yudhvir Singh said farmers will take time to switch to other crops but the government should promote crop diversification by providing some incentive. The Centre should take the paddy stubble from Punjab and distribute it as animal feed to 3 lakh stray cattle in Uttar Pradesh, he suggested. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar told the state Assembly that the government was giving facilities to farmers so that they don't burn stubble. We distributed 10,000 machines last year while 15,000 machines have been distributed this year, on which we are giving 80 per cent subsidy.""He said setting fire to crop residues was responsible only for 18-20 per cent of the pollution problem, adding incidents of crop burning in Haryana have significantly come down over the past few days and the situation was much better now. As per NASA satellite imagery and Haryana Space Applications Centre, the (stubble burning) problem looks very little in Haryana, he said. Several opposition members including Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said in the name of pollution, farmers were being blamed and defamed. ""The AQI is back to 'very poor' category after rapidly recovering from 'severe' largely due to faster boundary layer winds (40 kmph)."" said the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR. Though Haryana and Punjab recorded 4,962 farm fires, the season's highest, on Monday and north westerly winds, which carry smoke from stubble burning, continued to blow, Delhi air quality's ""continued to recover"", it said. ""PM Narendra Modi chaired a meeting in which the situation arising due to pollution in various parts of northern India was discussed,"" the Prime Minister's Office(PMO) tweeted. The meet on pollution followed back-to-back review meetings held by P K Mishra, the principal secretary to the prime minister, with top officials of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana on Sunday and Monday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi's air quality index dropped from 365 at 9.45 am to 331 at 3.45 pm on Tuesday. In the NCR, Greater Noida (348), Noida (358), Ghaziabad (351), Faridabad (311) and Gurgaon (328) also recorded improvement in air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category. NRAA CEO Ashok Dalwai said state governments should educate farmers to shift to non-paddy crops by providing some incentives ""One solution is to grow short-duration paddy varieties. If we are able to harvest by September, then farmers will get a longer window to undertake proper harvesting and prepare the land for wheat sowing,"" Dalwai told PTI. At present, the window for paddy harvesting is around 20-25 days, putting pressure on farmers to get rid of the crop residue and prepare the land for sowing wheat. On top of it, they are facing a labour shortage, he said. Since Punjab has low groundwater levels and paddy being a water-guzzling crop, Dalwai said, ""It is better we shift from paddy cultivation and grow more water-efficient crops like oilseeds and maize. That would solve the problem.""He also said short-duration varieties of non-paddy crops should be encouraged as the concern for farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is to prepare the land for winter wheat. Dalwai, also chairman of the Committee on Doubling of Farmers' Income, further said: ""We can easily shift from paddy in wheat-growing states as paddy can be grown in many other areas in the country. ""Whereas wheat cannot be grown everywhere as winter is required. So, wheat cannot be compromised. That has to be here. So, we can look at an alternative for paddy in north India.""Stating that the country has many short-duration paddy varieties, Dalwai said, ""We need to promote them. One needs to look at yields level to encourage farmers to shift. This is not something impossible to do. We can always test these varieties and do it.""He also suggested the state governments can provide an incentive to shift to other crops..PTI LUX NAB GVS SUN VSD TKP GSN."	https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/javadekar-reviews-steps-taken-by-delhi-neighbouring-states-to-tackle-air-pollution-119110901295_1.html	0.8927424550056458	Stubble burning: Authorities look for solutions; PM Modi reviews situation	"Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday reviewed the steps being taken by Delhi and neighbouring states to combat air pollution, while urging their governments to stop blaming each other and start acting in synergy.

Javadekar said the state governments have been urged to work together and not indulge in a blame game over the hazardous pollution levels in northern India. The national capital's air quality remained ""very poor"" on Friday, days after hovering around ""severe"" and ""severe plus"" category. ""There are local factors like waste burning, dust, industrial and vehicular pollution, which contribute to 70-80 per cent pollution. Everyone should think about how to reduce this pollution. I have appealed to them to not blame each other for it and work towards reducing pollution together,"" he said. Javadekar said that contribution of stubble burning in pollution has reduced. ""The governments concerned have been directed to implement their action plans. Last week, stubble burning contributed to 30-35 per cent in pollution, it has now reduced to 3-4 per cent,"" he said.

British folk-rock sensations Mumford & Sons and American star Halsey were among the headliners for the festival this year, which was scheduled for November 22-24. “Due to the escalation of the crisis this week, and therefore the uncertainty this creates for the coming weeks, Clockenflap 2019 will be cancelled,” the organisers said in a statement. “Until this week we were fully committed to delivering the festival. Unfortunately, the situation has now made this impossible.” Pro-democracy protests have escalated in the past week with widespread travel chaos wrought by roadblocks and targeted vandalism of metro stations and lines. Violent clashes between police and protesters have left parts of the city debris-strewn. Last Friday, a 22-year-old student died from head injuries sustained during a fall as police skirmished with demonstrators. And on Thursday, a 70-year-old man died after being hit by a brick. Clockenflap is an annual festival that takes place in front of Hong Kong’s iconic harbour and attracts tens of thousands of fans. It is the latest in a growing list of banned, cancelled or postponed events in Hong Kong’s normally packed social calendar.

https://www.elle.com/culture/a28773468/alanis-morrissette-jagged-little-pill-musical/	"Alanis Morissette is being generous. I'm telling her about my first concert, at the Tweeter Center in Massachusetts. (I was a superfan of Tori Amos, who opened for her.) And she's claiming to remember said concert, which took place sometime in the late '90s. Morissette either has a steel-trap memory for every one of the likely thousands of tour dates she's played, or, more likely, is humoring me, something she surely is used to doing with the junior Gen X'ers and elder millennials who probably subject her to similar anecdotes daily. We've all dragged out the vowels of ""You Oughta Know"" in a post-breakup caterwaul; we've all argued about whether the situations presented in ""Ironic"" really constitute irony (a black fly in your chardonnay? Nope. But a death row pardon, two minutes too late? That's positively Chekhovian.) My best friend maintains that, though he's not engaged, he already knows that a string version of ""You Learn"" will accompany his walk down the aisle. Alanis, to put it mildly, means a lot to a lot of us. For many of those people, Morissette’s 1995 album Jagged Little Pill is a classic recording (dare to disagree publicly and face the wrath of Gen X Twitter), and as such, it’s one that fans have their own, closely guarded internal version of. Now it’s being brought to life outside those dusty Discmans via a new musical directed by Diane Paulus (Waitress). Rather than the usual loose autobiography threaded together by songs, the production’s book (by Diablo Cody) reimagines the music in the context of a dysfunctional family. Reworkings of “You Learn” and “Ironic” join two new Morissette tunes, “Smiling” and “Predator.” And just in case the holy trinity of Morissette, Cody, and Paulus wasn't enough, choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, the man behind Beyoncé's iconic chair dance at the 2017 Grammys, is also on board. After the team behind the show contacted him, they learned that he, too, was a Jagged Little Pill superfan; he grew up in Antwerp listening to the album on repeat. ""This album has a kind of resonance that is so deep and profound and generational,"" says Paulus. ""How do we do justice to that, and also introduce a whole new generation to this music?"" For Morissette, the goal wasn't to live up to everyone's personal experience of the album. ""There’s no way I could,"" she says. And she was adamant about not making her life experiences part of the plot. ""I feel like if I were to do that, it would be to, seven years from now, do a one-person play."" (Which, if I may editorialize, sounds like...something I would like to see!) ""I’m frankly in denial about some of it,"" she says of her life story. ""I wasn’t ready yet to do that."" The show will have its built-in audience of people in their 30's and 40's, but it also appeals to a younger crowd. Like Paulus's daughter, who was 3 when Jagged Little Pill was released and who, says the director, ""doesn't know Alanis Morissette except through the musical."" Gen Z, which is looking back to Gen X in so many ways, from its embrace of grunge style to the neo-riot-grrrl music of artists like Boygenius, is primed to discover her work in the same way. ""There’s a lack of self-consciousness,"" Morissette says of the decade's renewed appeal in a FaceTuned world. ""I think in the '80's there was this very presentational, entrepreneurial [mood], and the '90's was sort of the pendulum swinging, going: You know what, I’m just going to wear this shirt, this hair and makeup, and it’s going to be kind of crass, greasy, somewhat ill-fitting. It was a good time to be alive as a young woman in that sense."" Also appealing: ""the quality of mystery, of not over-inundating people with too much information. Putting the pieces out there and not being so self-conscious about it."" (""I could go on for a while about Gen X,"" she adds.) The show, which begins previews November 3rd and officially opens on December 5th, has cast blue-chip Broadway talent, including Elizabeth Stanley (On the Town), Lauren Patten (Fun Home), and Celia Rose Gooding (who is making her Broadway debut, but is already theater royalty: her mom is musical-theater legend LaChanze.) And anyone expecting a straightforward singalong-style approach in the vein of the aforementioned karaoke versions of ""You Oughta Know,"" should probably look elsewhere. “We added color, complexity, great themes,” Morissette says of the score. (Next to Normal's Tom Kitt is responsible for the arrangements.) “It wasn’t just crass finger painting all over [the original]. We did it in a very classy way.” She adds that her transition to the theater world has been smooth, except for one thing: “I’m still clueless about the terminology. I’m like, ‘What’s that thing where you all get together and practice?’ They’re like, ‘Yeah, it’s called a rehearsal.’ ”"	https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-miles-behind-celtic-fans-20788660	0.8589501976966858	Alanis Morissette Knows You Love the '90's	The final act before the curtain comes down just had to be the Hotline. After two amazing decades at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail yours truly has decided to “do walking away” to join Ally McCoist in his garden and Craig Levein down the Job Centre. But before I go there’s just enough time for one last blast from the column that epitomises the spirit of this newspaper. Confession time. We all give a mock grumble when it’s our turn to man the phones and, quite frankly, it’s never been the same since that Hugh Keevins left, has it? But the Hotline is the beloved beating heart of Daily Record Sportbecause it’s our brilliant little version of the local boozer.   The place where punters - though divided by their team allegiances - are united in their love of the game, their dislike of referees and the banter. Especially the banter. So let’s get this farewell party started with some calls about a fellow job seeker. Stephen Johnstone, Ardentinny, said: “ Craig Levein isn’t the first and he won’t be the last manager to get the bullet. If Ian McCall’s Partick Thistle players don’t pull their socks up he’ll be joining him in the dole queue soon.” Frank McFerrin, Carrickfergus, said: “Ok, Craig Levein had to go from his job in management? But some people like Gary Mackay want him out on his ear completely, not earning a living. “Obviously Mrs Budge has trust in him so it’s her business. Maybe a bit of jealousy here, Gary?” Lewis Fotheringham, Mount Ellen, said: “I’m not a Hearts fan but I do not understand why Craig Levein is still on payroll for the remainder of the season, despite being sacked from TWO jobs. “It just shows there is an old pals act between Levein and Ann Budge. There could be suspicions amongst fans that Levein will still have some influence in executive decisions in the future.” Eddie Easson, Ballingry, said: “There is only one person to blame for the debacle at Hearts and that is Anne Budge. She enjoyed all the plaudits when she took over. “She gave Levein the keys to Tynecastle and she agreed to his dream team of Ian Cathro and Austin McCann where he was the puppeteer pulling the strings. “He took over the show and was an abject failure. Incredibly he is still there. Mrs Budge had better get it right next time.” Duncan Fraser, Auchterarder, said: “I wonder how many managers in the last 30 years have been sacked, liked Levein, immediately after defeat from St Johnstone. “Certainly Paul Heckingbottom must be looking at the fixture list just now and nervously seeing that his next league game is at McDiarmid Park.” Levein might be welcome to see out his contract by working behind the scenes but Dundee United fan Ronald Swan, Lochee, is ready to offer him a new job straight away. Ronnie said: “Mr Ogren, get on the phone to Levein asap and get him back to Tannadice to work with Robbie Neilson as his director football. If Robbie doesn’t like it, tough luck.” Alfie Mullin, London, added: “It’s a shame that poor Craig Levein got the bullet. Mind you, he shouldn’t worry too much about it. There will be a vacancy at Celtic Park in a few months that he can go for.” But what about the next Hearts boss? John Davidson, Armadale, said: “All this hype about Stephen Robinson as the front runner for the Hearts job, I don’t believe to be true. The bargain buy is Jack Ross. He’s got Hearts connections and was part of the previous coaching set-up before making a name for himself at St Mirren.” Rangers fans are feeling confident after their 4-0 thumping of Ross County in midweek, but Daniel Caldwell, Kelty, hit back: “Reading these Rangers fans crowing about their team I was wondering if I was reading The Dandy, not the Hotline. “If they genuinely think they are close to Celtic they are seriously over-optimistic about the standard of their team and the state of their club. “Do they forget the first Old Firm game of the season when Celtic destroyed them on their own patch?” Steve McSherry, Uddingston, added: “Will Rangers fans ever learn to shut up? Every year for the last three they were going to win the league. “Now this year they are going to win the treble. This fake optimism must embarrass sensible fans. They have improved but are still miles behind Scotland’s biggest and most successful club.” I sense a heated debate coming on here, so I’m just going to step aside and leave you guys to it. Thanks for everything, Hotliners. It’s been entertaining.

https://www.businesstraveller.com/airlines/2019/11/13/emirates-improves-travel-experience-with-airport-maps/	Emirates, Dubai-based airline has added a new feature on its app called ‘Airport Maps’, which will allow passengers to easily navigate through the airport. According to the airline, the new feature ‘Airport maps’ can detect the user’s location using Bluetooth and wifi as well as direct passengers to different areas of the airport including check-in desks, Emirates lounges, shops, restaurants and ATMs among others. The airline also believes that this will help enhance airport experiences for travellers worldwide. While the airline’s main hub, Dubai International Airport Terminal 3 has been included in the feature, several other major airports in the Emirates network like Hong Kong International Airport, London Heathrow and London Gatwick have also been added it. Around 90 million passengers transit through Dubai international Airport each year and the wayfinding technology was introduced to provide convenience to passengers. Emirates has been updating and enhancing its app regularly. Last year, Emirates app was enhanced with new technology allowing customers to create bespoke playlists for their inflight entertainment ahead of their travels and sync it to their seats once onboard. In 2018, Business Traveller reported Emirates developed a new app aimed at reducing delays caused by the turnaround of its B777 and A380 aircraft at Dubai International airport and Emirates Skywards launching a new taxi booking app. emirates.com	https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/11/14/emirates-upgrades-its-mobile-app-with-airport-maps-feature/	0.9254088401794434	Emirates improves travel experience with ‘Airport Maps’	Travellers with Emirates’ mobile app might now find it easier to find check-in desks, Emirates lounges, shops and other touch points at select airports worldwide.

https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/11/17/tennis/stefanos-tsitsipas-dominic-thiem-set-title-match-atp-finals/	LONDON – The first time Dominic Thiem played at the ATP Finals, he was handed an unknown Greek teenager as a hitting partner in training. Three years later, Thiem is facing that same player in the final of the season-ending tournament. Thiem beat defending champion Alexander Zverev in the semifinals on Saturday after Stefanos Tsitsipas ousted six-time winner Roger Federer, setting up a title match between two players who first met each other at O2 Arena under very different circumstances. “I just saw a picture before that I practiced with him the first time I played here 2016,” Thiem said after beating Zverev 7-5, 6-3. “He was a hitting partner here. It’s an amazing story for both of us. … We didn’t think that only three years later we were going to face each other in the final.” The now 21-year-old Tsitsipas had the most eye-catching win on Saturday, saving 11 of 12 break points to beat Federer 6-3, 6-4. He also took advantage of an error-filled performance from Federer, who continually put his opponent under pressure only to come up short when it mattered. “I’m proud of myself, how hard I fought today, how concentrated I stayed in the breakpoints,” said Tsitsipas, who reached the biggest final of his career. “Didn’t crack under pressure. I was very composed and very mature in my decisions.” In the evening match, Zverev doubled-faulted on set point to hand Thiem a 1-0 lead and was then broken for the second time to make it 4-2 in the second set. Thiem saved two break points in the next game to hold for 5-2, and then served out the match on his first attempt, clinching the victory with a forehand winner on match point. The final pairing also ensures that the tournament will have a first-time champion for the fourth year in a row. Federer and Novak Djokovic combined to win the ATP Finals nine times in 10 years between 2006-15 before Andy Murray broke that streak and Gregor Dimitrov won it in 2017. Zverev was trying to repeat last year’s title win but couldn’t convert any of the four break points he forced against Thiem. As he sat down for the changeover after his double-fault to end the first set, he slammed his racket down so hard it bounced along the court and came to rest behind the baseline. He was also frustrated with the way he gave away a cheap break in the second set. “I broke myself. I missed two overheads one meter away from the net,” Zverev said. “It was just a bad game. Yeah, the match was over a few games later, so what can I do?” Thiem beat both Federer and Djokovic in the group stage just to reach the semifinals for the first time in four attempts at the tournament. Tsitsipas, who is making his first appearance at the event, saved all six break points he faced against Federer in the first set. That included two at 5-3, when he needed seven set points before finally winning a marathon game. He broke again for a 2-1 lead in the second, then saved three break points from 0-40 in the next game before Federer finally converted his fourth to level the set. But Tsitsipas broke again straight away with a forehand winner and then saved two more break points from 15-40 down when serving for the match at 5-4. He didn’t give the 38-year-old Federer any more chances of a comeback, serving out the match with an ace. “No doubt I had my chances,” Federer said. “I’m just frustrated I couldn’t play better. And when I did and fought my way back, I threw it away again.” The 17-year age gap between the two players was the largest in the history of the tournament. For Federer, it was a surprisingly erratic performance after he played near-flawless tennis to beat Djokovic in straight sets on Thursday to reach the semifinals. He finished that match with five unforced errors — including two double-faults — but had 26 in this match. Federer was especially unhappy with the service break in the first set, when he also missed two fairly routine overheads to gift his opponent the early lead. “Getting broken with missing two smashes in one game, that hasn’t happened in a long, long time. Or ever,” Federer said. “So that was tough.” GET THE BEST OF THE JAPAN TIMESIN FIVE EASY PIECES WITH TAKE 5JOIN THE CONVERSATION	https://www.boston25news.com/news/tsitsipas-beats-federer-to-reach-atp-finals-in-london/1009311508?utm_source=homestream&utm_medium=site_navigation&utm_campaign=homestream_click	0.9963923096656799	Stefanos Tsitsipas, Dominic Thiem set up title match at ATP Finals	"LONDON (AP) - The first time Dominic Thiem played at the ATP Finals, he was handed an unknown Greek teenager as a hitting partner in training.

https://www.bustle.com/p/the-2020-met-gala-theme-hosts-have-been-announced-19308947	2020 isn't here yet, but fashion's biggest night is ready for the new decade. The 2020 Met Gala theme and its co-hosts have been announced, and as usual, the inspiration for the event will offer a unique perspective on fashion and red carpet moments sure to drop jaws. Next year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will be celebrate its 150th year, and the Costume Institute's theme fits the occasion. About Time: Fashion and Duration will be the subject of the exhibition.According to Vogue, the exhibit will trace fashions dating back to the 1870s until present and will examine the ways in which design and style can be disrupted from the typically linearly viewed perspective of fashion history. Speaking with the magazine, Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute, explains that the exhibit as well as the gala has multiple inspirations such as the philosophies of Henri Bergson and the works of Virginia Wolfe, but one specifically cited is the 1992 film Orlando — which is based Wolfe's novel of the same name. Bolton cites a scene in the film where star Tilda Swinton enters a maze in 18th century period clothing and as she travels, her dress changes to a piece from the 19th century until eventually she's in Elizabethan clothing. Swinton's movement through the maze and the sartorial change that occurs captures the heart of the gala's theme, the way clothing can be seen as a linear progression but can also be juxtaposed with other periods to reveal similarities throughout a timeline. The exhibit, of course, informs the theme of the gala, and with such a broad scope to work with, the styles on the carpet during the first Monday in May will be diverse. Viewers can likely expect to see designers and attendees playing with the idea of period dress and trend-driven style moments throughout history but pushing them up against and juxtaposing them with more modern silhouettes and designs. The sartorial choices may also showcase the way fashions can be cyclical, taking famous designs through history — think flapper style frocks or corseting — and turning them back in on themselves to transform into something new. As for the hosts of the fundraising event, actors Emma Stone, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and Meryl Streep have been tasked with the duties. Streep's name on the list is particularly exciting as the multi-award winning actor has not attended the gala in the past. Alongside the celebrity hosts, Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquière (who attended last year's event with now co-host Emma Stone) has also been asked to lead the event, and the fashion house will be sponsoring the exhibit as well. With such a vast array of sartorial choices in a multitude of timelines, the 2020 Met Gala may be one of the most intriguing yet. Mark your calendars now because the first Monday in May is coming sooner than you think.	https://www.cbsnews.com/news/met-gala-2020-theme-announced-about-time/	0.9079830646514893	The 2020 Met Gala Theme & Hosts Have Been Announced	"Next year, the famed Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City celebrates its 150th anniversary. The milestone will be marked by new exhibits, public events and of course the highly anticipated Met Gala. To give those on the invite-only guest list time to prepare for the May fundraiser, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute has just announced the theme for the 2020 event and exhibit: ""About Time: Fashion and Duration.""  The exhibition will take attendees back in time, familiarizing them with the styles of the 1870s and taking them on a fashion journey through the 19th and 20th centuries to the present. The Met says the theme was influenced by French philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of ""la durée"" — time that flows, accumulates, and is indivisible — and the 160-piece collection will be a comprehensive guide to understanding how fashion and time are coupled, with Virginia Woolf serving as the ""ghost narrator."" ""Fashion is indelibly connected to time. It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times, serving as an especially sensitive and accurate timepiece,"" Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, said in a press release. The temporal theme for fashion's biggest night is sure to bring out unusual and creative costume ideas, as have years past. This year's theme, ""Camp: Notes on Fashion,"" saw the fashionable flood the red carpet in an array of eccentric shapes and bold colors. In contrast to 2019's ""Camp"" theme, organizers say next year's exhibit will be comprised of more somber ensembles, with a focus on black outfits that will reflect the evolution of modernity, with white ensembles interspersed to express the ""fleeting rhythm of fashion."" For instance, a black silk faille princess-line dress from the late 1870's will be paired with an Alexander McQueen ""Bumster"" skirt from 1995. ""This exhibition will consider the ephemeral nature of fashion, employing flashbacks and fast-forwards to reveal how it can be both linear and cyclical,"" Max Hollein, director of The Met, said in a press release. ""As such, the show will present a nuanced continuum of fashion over the Museum's 150-year history."" The exhibition will also feature a section on the future of fashion. The 2020 Met Gala co-chairs will be Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton women's wear, ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, actresses Emma Stone and Meryl Streep, and Met Gala staple Anna Wintour. The renowned benefit will take place May 4, 2020, with the exhibit open to the public from May 7 until September 7, 2020."

https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/a-good-place-nottingham-forest-3534706	Nottingham Forest have gone into the international break in a good place. Winning away at Luton Town and winning a massive game at home against Derby County, that’s a good way to go into the break - and to put those successive defeats behind us. We just need to make sure we come out of the break in the right way, unlike last time when we lost two on the bounce. We’re fifth at the moment, which isn’t a bad position to be in. And we’ve got a game in hand. We always talk about how difficult the Championship is, though. It’s a beast. You can see that in how tight the table is. No-one is really pulling away at the top yet. West Bromwich Albion are obviously doing well and are leading the way at the moment. They look like they could be in contention to open up a bit of ground at the top. But it’s not happened yet. They are still within touching distance of plenty of other teams. Forest are only five points behind them, with that game in hand. West Brom looked good against us on the opening day of the season, but we still could have beat them. We went 1-0 up then sat back and did nothing for the rest of the game. The Championship is there for the taking, if anyone wants it. Someone just needs to take it by the scruff of the neck. There are so many teams still in contention - right down to midway in the table. That tells you the quality of the division. West Brom have been winning games. We’ve been winning games. Preston are still doing brilliantly. You’d expect Leeds will be there or thereabouts. But at the minute, there’s no one standout team. It’s a cliche but anyone really can beat anyone. Luton could quite easily pick up a good result against someone. Stoke might turn their season around. Teams like Hull have put together decent runs. I thought Cardiff would be one of the teams up there, but it’s not worked out like that yet. It’s a real shame to see Neil Warnock go from there. He steered the club through a difficult time, on and off the pitch, and did a magnificent job. Wherever he’s been, I don’t think you can knock what he’s done. He’s been a terrific manager, he’s a character and if he does decide to call it a day now, it will be a sad loss to the game. It will be interesting to see how Cardiff do now. At the moment, the table is so tight. If you lose a few games you can drop down to mid-table and if you win a few, you’re right up there. All Forest can do is keep winning games. Keep doing what we have been doing. We’re very resilient; a solid side. Teams don’t score many goals against us - and we’ve got to keep it that way. With the players we’ve got, we’ve always got a chance then, of going forward and creating something. Sooner or later that attacking midfield is really going to click, and when that happens we’ll be a very dangerous team. But we’re still looking okay at the moment. Some people might say it’s better than okay, but we can’t get ahead of ourselves. It’s just great because in the past we’ve always been looking at the bottom half of the table. This time, there is a lot of hope and positivity around the City Ground. It’s great to be a Forest fan at the moment, but we can’t rest on our laurels. The biggest game is always the next one.

The Down champions were pushed all the way by the five-in-a-row Fermanagh champions but in the end, it was Aaron Branagan’s goal that separated the two sides. The centre-back finished with a haul of 1-1 in a man of the match performance and gave a memorable interview to RTÉ afterwards. “We tend to leave it late to push on in games. We know how to get over the line and we know how to dog out games. It was well refereed. “That’s the way we like it, nice and tough.” Champions of Down for the sixth time in seven years and back in an Ulster final, Gaelic football is clearly number one in the small village outside Newry. According to Branagan, there isn’t much else to the place other than Gaelic football. One of five brothers on the team, he continued to joke saying they talk more about sheep than they do about football before heaping some well deserved praise onto legendary manager Mickey Moran who is still producing the goods. “Football gets a wee bit of talk as well. It’s nice to play with your brothers. “Mickey is something else. I always say he’s like the grandad I never had. He’s the best. Everything he says, everybody is totally attentive. “He knows what to do, how to get us over the line. He calms us down. There’s no shouting.” Can’t beat the club championships.

https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28076663/pakistan-host-sri-lanka-two-test-series-december	"Pakistan are set to host a Test series for the first time in ten years, against Sri Lanka next month. The two-match series will be played in Rawalpindi and Karachi, on December 11 and 19 respectively. The Test series was originally scheduled to be played in October - with the limited-over series initially slated for December - and was reportedly supposed to be played at a neutral venue as Sri Lankan players had refused to tour Pakistan. But PCB requested Sri Lanka to play the entire bilateral series in Pakistan, assuring the highest level of security. The limited-overs series was then played first as a test for security measures taken by the hosts. Following the success of the tour, a convinced Sri Lanka agreed to play in Pakistan again. ""We are pleased to confirm our return visit to Pakistan as, based on our earlier visit, we are comfortable and convinced conditions are suitable and conducive for Test cricket,"" SLC chief executive Ashley de Silva said in a statement. ""We also believe all cricket playing countries should host international cricket at home and in this relation we are happy to play our part in complete resumption of international cricket in Pakistan, which not only has a proud history but has been one of our biggest supporters in our early days as a cricket nation. Top Sri Lankan players had pulled out of the Pakistan trip in September, forcing SLC to send a second-string team to play the limited-overs series in Lahore and Karachi. With the visitors ending the tour on a high, winning the T20I series 3-0, Sri Lanka coach Rumesh Ratnayake signed off with lavish praise on Pakistan, calling the tour a success both on and off the field, adding he was confident that Sri Lanka soon wouldn't be the only ones to have visited Pakistan. ""We drew our opening World Test Championship series against New Zealand, and I anticipate, like in the past, these two Tests will be exciting and competitive, and the fans will thoroughly enjoy the quality of cricket that will be on display."" Lahore, which hosted all three matches of the T20I series, missed out on hosting one of the Tests due to a forecast of foggy weather on the given dates. The Rawalpindi cricket stadium, which will host its first Test in 15 years, is understood to be extensively renovated. ""This is fabulous news for Pakistan and its reputation of being as safe and secure as any other country in the world,"" said Zakir Khan, PCB director of international cricket. ""We are thankful to Sri Lanka Cricket for agreeing to send their team for the longer version of the game, which will contribute significantly in the PCB's efforts and drive for regular resumption of international cricket, and help in its endeavours of attracting new audiences and younger generation. ""Now that the itinerary has been confirmed, we will shift our focus on series preparations to ensure we deliver arrangements as per our very high standards. This series is part of our cricket celebrations and we will leave no stone unturned in putting up a show which is a memorable one for the players, officials, fans and media."" Sri Lanka were also the last team to play Tests there; it was the ambush by terrorists on their team bus in Lahore in March 2009 that effectively ended international cricket in Pakistan. Several members of that team were injured in the attack, with Thilan Samaraweera the most seriously hurt among them, taking a bullet to the thigh. No international cricket was played in Pakistan in the first half of this decade, but cricket has gradually begun to return over the last few years."	https://www.dawn.com/news/1516675	0.8847732543945312	Pakistan to host Sri Lanka for two-Test series in December	"Test cricket is set to return to Pakistan after over a decade when Sri Lanka team plays its World Test Championship matches in the country in December, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Thursday. In a press release, PCB said that Sri Lanka will play two test matches in Pakistan: ""Originally, Sri Lanka were scheduled to play Tests in October and then return in December for white-ball cricket, but the matches were swapped to provide them the opportunity to assess the situation before deciding on the Test venues,"" the press release stated. According to PCB, the Test series was confirmed today after Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) agreed to fulfil their 'Future Tours Programme' commitment ""following a highly successful visit for white-ball cricket"".

Becauseour preseason rankingsweren't enough, we will keep doing weekly updates based on the natural fluctuation of football's most important position. Week 11 brings a few more changes as our rankings continue to mirror the QB top-heavy MVP race. The most dynamic of the young dual threats enjoy a strong week, while at leastoneoverpaid traditional pocket passer takes a tumble. From the best to the worst current starters for every team, let the debate continue. WEEK 11 NFL PICKS: Against the spread | Straight up 1. Russell Wilson, Seahawks (last week: 1) Leave it to Wilson to throw a rare interception in overtime but rebound with a big run to put his team back in position to win, anyway, without his best wide receiver. After the instant-classic win over the 49ers wasmostly about his relentless dazzle, it's him and everyone else for MVP. 2. Lamar Jackson, Ravens (4) Jackson's MVP case is strangely being hurt by how well the Ravens' defense is playing well again at the moment. He's headed for at least offensive player of the year with the QB rushing record. He did beat Wilson head-to-head, however, and taking a few more big QB duels just might allow him to clip Wilson at the tape. 3. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs (3) Mahomes went back to raising his game after his knee injury to try to carry the team more as reigning MVP with the defense letting Kansas City down in every way and the running game fighting through inconsistent personnel. It's clear they need all of his very best down the stretch to return to the playoffs. 4. Deshaun Watson, Texans (2) Watson can build his case behind Wilson and Jackson byoutshining the latter on the same field in Baltimore. He should have his full complement of healthy receivers with whom to go to work. Watch out if Watsoncan deliver against a high degree of difficultyvs. a deep defensive backfield. 5. Dak Prescott, Cowboys (7) Prescott had the Hail Mary interception against the Vikings, but he would have never been put in that position had Dallas allowed him to relentlessly throw the ball with the game on the line before that drive. More a red-hot Dak, less Zeke is the key for the Cowboys to not blow their playoff chances. NFL POWER RANKINGSPatriots pass 49ers; Ravens, Packers, Vikings head north for Week 11 6. Aaron Rodgers, Packers (5) Rodgers had another TD-less game in Week 10 at home against the Panthers but he's still rating (102.7) right around his NFL record career efficiency (102.7). He kind of has a point when saying Aaron Jones, based on the success of the Packers' running game, deserves more MVP talk than he does. 7. Tom Brady, Patriots (8) Brady had a bye to reevaluate some limitations in the Patriots' offense based on a shaky power running game and compressed passing game. He should come out throwing heavy into short-to-intermediate routes with now cogo-to guys Julian Edelman and Mohamed Sanu. They need his GOAT-ness to keep up the momentum toward another Super Bowl after their first loss. 8. Carson Wentz, Eagles (9) Wentz has played much better than his numbers would indicate because hismental toughness and hard-nosed athleticism have pushed the Eagles back in the playoff race, playing well off more dedication to the running game to compensate for having no deep passing game. 9. Drew Brees, Saints (6) Brees was roughed up a bit against the Falcons and had his worst outing of the season, two weeks removed from returning his thumb injury. The Saints are still more about the defense and the running game, so when those aren't working, Brees can only do so much with a thin receiving corps and a still banged-up Alvin Kamara. He really needs a get-well game against the Bucs' depleted secondary. 10. Kirk Cousins, Vikings (11) Cousins came through in a big game on the road against the Cowboys, protecting the ball and finishing drives with the efficiency he's shown all season playing of the running and receiving of Dalvin Cook. His career-best 112.0 rating is spectacular. 11. Jimmy Garoppolo, 49ers (12) Garoppolo didn't keep the Niners undefeated when Wilson outlasted him last Monday night, but he was doing his best while missing his two best pass-catchers (George Kittle and Emmanuel Sanders) and running game down a man (Matt Breida). There's no question he's rising at the right time with equally big matchups around the corner. 12. Matt Ryan, Falcons (13) Ryan had more of a grinding game in the upset win over the Saints, but now he has to deal with lesser checkdown and downfieldsupport with Devonta Freeman and Austin Hooper on the shelf. It's been a lost season for his team but Ryan has hung in there and can help the Falcons finish strong with Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley. 13. Derek Carr, Raiders (14) The Raiders are running the ball well with Josh Jacobs and have surprisingly made some big plays on defense. But Carr's ability to protect the ball and distribute at such a high level shows in his 70.8 completion rate, 7.8 yards per attempt and easy career-best 104.4 rating. 14. Jacoby Brissett, Colts (15) The Colts should be thrilled to have him back for the Jaguars. Their system was good enough to look OK with Brian Hoyer, but they had to appreciate Brissett's grittiness and more careful control of the ball a lot more after losing two games late without him. He has to fight toplay well to ensure a trip to the playoffs with the team having a lot of injury issues around him. 15. Kyler Murray, Cardinals (17) Murray put together two great games in a row for the first time in his NFL career. They were both losses, but he put the Cardinalsin position to win with his spreading the ball all over the field, where young speedsters Christian Kirk and Andy Isabella being on the field togetherhas made a difference for his fine rookie development under Kliff Kingsbury. NFL BACKUP QB QUIZ:Can you name your favorite team's second-stringer? 16. Jameis Winston, Buccaneers (19) Winston is inching toward locking up his next big contract in Tampa Bay. He keeps backing up Bruce Arians on his improved overall play as a downfield passer. There were more interceptions against the Cardinals, but it's more about the passes he's been able to make with an elite receiving corps. He also keeps picking good spots to run. 17. Baker Mayfield, Browns (21) Mayfield turned in a great game on Thursday night, his best of the season while in rhythm with all of his receivers short and deep against a tough Steelers pressure defense. It was a game resembling what we expected to see a lot more of in Year 2. He still has plenty of time to end on a rookie-like high with some great matchups ahead. 18. Philip Rivers, Chargers (18) Rivers had the interception meltdown against the Raiders in what's been his worst season under Anthony Lynn. He will need to play his best game of the sason— a throwback to '18 —against the Chiefs, by far, to save the Chargers' playoff chances. 19. Kyle Allen, Panthers (23) Allen had some turnover troubles against the Packers' tough pass defense in the snow at Lambeau, but there was a command to his game, perhapsfeeling like he can keep this job longer than just the rest of the season with Cam Newton down. He's really making good use of his weapons beyond Christian McCaffrey. 20. Ryan Tannehill, Titans (24) Tannehill has gone 3-1 as Tennessee's starter while re-energizing theoffense with both his best downfield passing in a while and fearless running. He's really feeling it in their scheme the way Marcus Mariota should have. The Titans should really think about re-signing him now. 21. Daniel Jones, Giants (25) Jones was sneakily great against the Jets' weak pass defense, save for not seeing an incoming Jamal Adams to strip him of the ball and take it to the house. Darius Slayton and ""Danny Dimes"" looks like a money combination for many years. 22. Jared Goff, Rams (16) His offensive line is in pieces and his receiving corps really misses Brandin Cooks' ability to stretch the field. But better quarterbacks with his level of his salary tend to overcome those issues and lift the team, not further sink the team. The system QB knock won't be shaken, and the Bears won't help. 23. Josh Allen, Bills (22) Allen has been good for fantasy football because of his ability to run in touchdowns, but everyone can see his passing hasn't improved too much from his rookie season despite better wide receivers and a special rookie back and tight end. If the Bills don't hold on for the playoffs, it would be because of him. 24. Nick Foles, Jaguars (20) We don't know what to expect from Foles coming back from his broken collarbone because this passing game showed a ton of life with the mobile and fearless rookie Gardner Minshew. There's no question Foles has to play well in a must-win game against the Colts or the Minshew whispers will be heard louder. 25. Sam Darnold, Jets (28) Darnold put some ghosts to bed against the crosstown Giants but his play was still not all that clean or pretty. The Jets' offensive line and play-calling haven't been great in relation to his receivers, from Le'Veon Bell to Robby Anderson, but it's been overall a washout of a sophomore season. NFL MOCK DRAFT 2020: Which four QBs go in the first round? 26. Mason Rudolph, Steelers (27) Rudolph had his first really rough game as a second-year quarterback with his offensive line crumbling and his top running back and wide receiver hurting again. The four-interception game probably had been coming with a negative game script, and unfortunately, he'll now need to focus on recovering from the ugly Myles Garrett incident before Week 12. 27. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Dolphins (26) Fitzpatrick doesn't look pretty running or passing but he's definitely been a very good leader for Miami. The Dolphins respond well on both sides of the ball to his calming, grizzled presence. They're clearly not tanking and could end up with Tua Tagovailoa, anyway. 28. Mitchell Trubisky, Bears (29) Trubisky saw the Bears get into a hole against the Lions and despite mostly ineffectiveness, he dug deep to get them out of it with some clutch plays. But now the matchup raises greatly in difficulty at the Rams on Sunday night. 29. Brandon Allen, Broncos (30) Allen, before the bye, threw a couple of nice TD passes to Courtland Sutton and Noah Fant in an impressive,gritty performance taking over for Joe Flacco against the Browns. He draws a tough spot on the road at the Vikings with healthierrookie Drew Lock looming. 30. Jeff Driskel, Lions (not ranked) Driskel will be filling in again for Matthew Stafford, who unfortunately is dealing with back fractures during his best overall season. Driskel was a gamer against a tough Bears defense on short notice, but there was the expected big drop off and things don't get easier at home against the Cowboys. 31. Dwayne Haskins, Redskins (32) Haskins has to be better after getting prepped to start the rest of the season during the bye, right? It starts with connecting well his fellow former Buckeyes wide receiver Terry McLaurin against a bad Jets secondary behind the blitz. 32. Ryan Finley, Bengals (31) Finley looked very much like a rookie thrown into the fire in a bad supporting offense with his immediate big mistakes against the Ravens. Cincinnati should proceed with its plans (hopefully) to target a QB with the first overall draft pick."
